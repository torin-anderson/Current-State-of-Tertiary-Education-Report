3397,"take advantage of your school’s career center resources (and articles online) and teach yourself how to apply for scholarships. i applied for 30 as a high school senior and won i think 5 scholarships totaling around $3200. the scholarship season is january-february and might be slowing down now, but you can probably take out loans for the first year and apply to scholarships in the following years to cover the rest. i had a really good system for applying to scholarships and can send you some resources if you want; i can even help you find good programs in your state that would be open now. also, there are some scholarships only offered to returning students in your department that you can reapply to each year.

edit: also, get a summer job that allows you to work 40 hours a week and work as many weeks there as possible, like start right from the monday after high school graduation and work right up until the friday before you move to college. i’d recommend trying to get something over $13 an hour for the summer if you can. it sounds rough working full time but having the same routine every day is a lot like the high school schedule and having that routine can be easier than the ups and downs of college at times.

i found it hard to work more than 15 hours a week while in college, so once you’re there, try to find something with a high enough wage and definitely don’t settle for anything below $10-11. you can probably look on handshake and apply to things during the summer so you can start work asap and make as much money as possible.

the biggest thing is living expenses. if you can live at home, you have no idea how much money that will save you. i would do it. if you can’t do that, financial aid and scholarships will cover part of the dorms while living expenses will be out of your own pocket. do the math and figure out the cheapest option.

full disclosure, i got lucky and ended up having a surprise college fund from a relative that i didn’t find out about until the summer before college, but i still did all of these things to ensure i wouldn’t struggle financially. there are ways to do it but it’s hard. you should strongly consider how worth it the program is. i disagree with the sentiment that community college classes are “just as good” if you feel more at home and might learn better at the more expensive place; you’re investing in yourself and you pretty much get one shot at undergrad so you might as well go big or go home. and $15k a year is not that bad; that’s a little more than what i had to pay. you do need a lot of passion to make it work though.",0.1472642081021448

* i never really made friends in there.
* i did manage to ""pick up"" or ""get picked up"" and did have a one night stand or three over the years i went, but it was rare and unfulfilling. the better relationships were from online or through social/work networks. and nowadays, people frown on that because both of y'all are too drunk and there's been some embarrassing moments and waking up next to crazy.
* most bars are loud as hell and no meaningful conversations were ever had.
* got tired of felling like shit if i accidentally over drank.
* being too drunk out and about late at night (or anytime really or any place other than the house) is a legal and safety risk.

 i always told her that as much as i joked about us rooming together i would never pressure her into going to the same school as me. now i’m crying and i feel really bad for crying. i know it’s not going to end our friendship but she’s the one person i really didn’t want to leave. i don’t know if this makes me come across as selfish or what but i’m just so sad. i can’t even begin to describe how much i’m going to miss her.

i know i’ll make new friends in college and everything will be fine, but i want to let myself be sad right now  ",0.09016696346674324
1632,"is it insane? no. that’s actually a pretty normal amount of loans for a four year degree. i have some questions though. what year are you in school? because unless you’re graduating this spring you’re going to need more money. it could also be why you don’t feel like you know much about your field. 
what’s the projected starting salary for your desired job in your area? $50,000 is a lot of debt to pay off in two years even if you have almost no expenses. after 6 months you’re going to be paying interest on that, so the debt isn’t just 50k. 
do you know what you want to do with that degree? what made you want to choose that in the first place? i am admittedly not a business student, and i don’t know much about the job prospects for a marketing degree. but if you chose it you must of had a reason to pick it. also you don’t have to use that degree exactly as intended. there’s probably a lot of jobs that would appreciate someone with a built degree of any kind.",0.08980265101338746
2053,"this is a good start brother! don’t be embarrassed to want to increase your education and in return your life! 
i will try and break this down. 
you can apply online very easily, go on their website and fill out and online application for x college. typically they will not ask much regarding what you choose to study and such, but even if they do you can always change your major and such so dont feel forced to pick a subject and obligated to stick with it. 
the cost varies a lot. i recommend you try out a community college as it is much cheaper, especially if done online. you can get your tuition cost knocked down by applying for things like fafsa, scholarships and grants. colleges also help you with different types of loans. you can also go i to a degree that will pay itself off. you can go into something like hvac or any trade job that will often pay you to attend because it is in high demand. 
generally speaking most colleges will help you with this process especially counselors about the cost. there are financial aid offices and more, colleges typically walk you through this process but it would be a safe bet to start saving up a few grand. if you have a college in mind you can look up annual or semester expenses for that college.",0.08333333333333333

3131,"yes. i’m halfway through without a single loan. it’s not possible in every circumstance, but with the right combination of opportunity and planning, it’s very possible. examples:

1. qualifying for pell grants and going to a cheap enough college it covers all or most of the cost.

2. scholarships, either private or through the university/college. you can apply for more scholarships at any point during or before college!

3. employers that offer tuition payment/reimbursement as a benefit.

4. cheap school + lots of savings. might be combined with living with family or other cheap/rent-free living arrangements.

5. part-time school rather than full-time (costs more in the long run but cheaper in the short term so easier to pay) and payment plans.

i went to community college, then transferred to a cheap public university in-state. i qualify for the full pell grant which covers the majority of tuition. the rest i’ve paid for through small scholarships and my savings from working part time. i live with family to reduce living expenses.

if things continue as they are, i should be able to graduate without debt. if i ever want to do a master’s degree i’ll see if i can work for an employer that encourages it through benefits. pell grants aren’t really offered for graduate degrees, but the other options still work.",0.0778498944161523

i'm a college **freshman** at a **cuny school** (it's the one that mostly consists of finance majors, iykyk).

first let me start off with this: **i was accepted into nyu and fordham but could not afford it.** i went to boarding high school (with a hefty scholarship) where several of my close friends went to private institutions costing $50k+. since we were all super close, i allowed myself to believe i was ""one of them"" and also applied to these school with huge tuitions, not knowing i couldn't afford them. i also live with my high school sweetheart who goes to one of these ""expensive"" schools &amp; has their own place, so i'm getting a huge chunk off of my tuition already. anyways, **ninth grade me though i was gonna be at harvard or columbia,** and now i'm having a hard time ""coping"" with failing to achieve my biggest goals as a teen. it almost feels like i'm losing hope in myself. ***how did y'all cope?***

also!!!! **i'm a finance major** **but seriously don't know anything about finance.** like, not even a *rich dad poor dad* level of understanding, however, i like to believe that i can change that. how can i ""catch up"" in order to make the most out of my time in this finance school? ***finance majors: where did you start?*** do you have anything that really helped y'all progress in the finance world? whether it's harvard lectures, finance books for dummies, news subscriptions, or something like volunteering, i'm willing to learn as much as i can about finance in order to get ahead.",0.06666666666666667
97,"i have a complex situation i'm hoping y'all can help with: 
i enrolled in college directly after high school in 2018. went to school from fall 2018 until fall 2020. i had to leave school due to personal and family issues (mostly dealing with undiagnosed adhd, which is now diagnosed, and my mom's severe alcoholism, which she has since gotten help with). 

before, my grants and minimal federal loans were paying for my expenses quite well, but when my moms alcoholism started getting bad, there happened to be an issue with my fafsa and some missing tax information. i tried getting my mom to help me find the appropriate tax forms but she was always too incapacitated and i had no clue what i was looking for or how to get it, so it all ended up on the back burner. 

i tried contacting the school during february or march 2021 and they said it was too late, i was no longer considered a student and therefore would be ineligible to get federal aid or aid through the school to pay off my outstanding balance of $10k. 

now it's been 2 years, i've been working really hard on fixing my personal and family issues and i'm ready to go back hopefully summer of 2023. i already plan on calling my schools admissions and financial aid offices tomorrow, but is there anything you could recommend i do?? would it be worthwhile to try looking into maybe grants or scholarships available to children of alcoholic parents? also, could i use private loans from like collegeave to backpay what i owe from 2020? any advice is greatly appreciated, this has been a major struggle for the last two years and i'm finally ready to take my education back and finish my degree!! for reference i am in indiana. 

**tl;dr** had some tax issues that affected fafsa, alcoholic (now recovered) mom couldn't help me submit it all in time so i became ineligible for aid. owe the school $10k. trying to get finances back in order now so i can go back to school in 2023. thank you!!",0.06565321642986127
659,"a quick note: ***the goal of this post is not to shame nor expose professors. instead, i'm attempting to start a discussion about the changes in college etiquette and expectations on u.s. campuses as of lately.*** 

i'm a fifth-year senior at a major state university and i've noticed substantial changes in the faculty following the pandemic in my department. it's beginning to take a large emotional toll on me and i've been considering the value of education following this realization. 

i've had numerous professors within the last 2-3 years arrive to classes late, add additional coursework to an already established syllabus, cancel numerous classes that often result in 1-2 weeks of no class time, professors who cancel class for personal or professional trips, or display a general lack of respect for students. these things feel as if they come at the expense of my education. literally and figuratively. 

i must note: student behavior has changed, too. and in ways i don't feel i must make explicit-- we're all students who directly face the strenuous college lifestyle. perhaps this is attributing to these changes?

besides covid-19 and the lack of student engagement, i cannot find a solid ""answer"" to these cultural shifts on campus. additionally, i'm struggling to recognize if this is an isolated change at my college. i understand professors are people, too. i'm not attempting to shame nor interrogate professors. instead, i'm curious in how and/or why these cultural shifts surrounding college etiquette and expectations have changed.

essentially, for students who have been in college for 2+ years, **have you seen these cultural shifts on campus? changes in faculty regulations, behavior, guidelines? and, if so, how has this impacted your perception of education as an institution, or, your own academic outcomes?**",0.060745673923078704
469,"music school is kinda notorious for abusive and toxic advisor/private lesson relationships. see the movie whiplash for some cathartic stuff. it allowed me some room to be a little more critical of my toxic music school advisor after seeing that movie.

i had a similar experience when i did my undergrad in music performance. the guy i was taking lessons from and advising me had all sorts of lofty ideas for what i would be doing with a music performance degree, but was hilariously out of touch with the current trends in the industry. he was still pushing orchestra auditions and cruise ship gigs as if either were good options that could pay bills or provide a reasonable quality of life, assuming that i even won an audition. which is hilariously competitive, i.e. 100-200 people audition for an single spot, many of which are in there 30s with phds and a decade of daily practice.  
  
if i could redo it, i would change advisors to someone who wasn't so abusive and toxic. there are probably a half a dozen other voice teachers in your school, i would recommend seeing if you can change over to them. you don't deserve to be gaslit and belittled by this voice teacher. 

crying is not normal, but i will be honest that i had similar experiences, and all of the other students in my studio had similar experiences with our professor. none of us deserved his abuse, and it was absolutely not worth the suffering. i could have got a degree piece of paper from pretty much anyone and it would have been worth the same.

your vocal coach sounds like they are withholding praise to get you to work harder and spend more time trying to get better at performing. which... ok... but the reality of the music industry is pretty toxic even if you are an amazing vocalist.

\_\_\_

  
not sure if this helps but here is a timeline of how i ended up spending 4 years of my life in a toxic relationship in music school, still working on recovering via talk therapy now over 10 years later.

freshman year: i placed in all the top ensembles and got a constant stream of compliments and approval from most of my ensemble directors and main advisor.

sophomore year: i placed into even better ensembles but my advisor was starting to get super abusive and nitpicky and a real downer. 

junior year: some grad students showed up in my studio and were indeed better musicians than me, taking the top ensemble spots. advisor became increasingly abusive and i became depressed. realistically i was probably depressed before this...

senior year: advisor handed me off to the grad students for individual lessons, i was pretty mad about it, but they were way less abusive than he was. i stopped participating in the jazz bands as it wasn't required for graduating. i did the bare minimum in all my classes, graduated and moved back in with my parents.

\_\_\_

post graduation, i floundered around and got fired from six jobs within a year, all front line customer service jobs, restaurants, hospitality, call centers, etc. eventually managed to leverage family network into an entry level it job at a public school. lots of talk therapy and group therapy, and improving my it career skills later, i am pretty happy and content and have a lot of things figured out.

you don't deserve to be in an abusive relationship with someone who absolutely does not hold the keys to your future. the music industry is so fucked, that even if you were the best voice student in your program and your vocal teacher was great and you liked them, you still wouldn't end up with a job that pays the bills after doing grad school. well, you might, but i know so many amazing musicians who are destitute, or hustle super hard with all sorts of side jobs to make ends meet. 

if you really want to make it as a vocalist, you need to be in la, nashville, or nyc. thats it, there are no other options. well, i suppose other countries have their equivalents. if you aren't willing to be a starving artist hustling in those extremely expensive places, its probably time to start thinking about what you are going to do with your career, whatever it ends up being. if you can end up with that undergrad degree, change lesson teachers to someone not abusive, and then figure out your early 20s path to a career, it should work out in the end. if your parents are rich though, the rules change, you can probably spend the next 10 years practicing and living in one of the above cities and eventually make it work.

you got this op, and you absolutely don't deserve to be verbally abused.",0.04068942293855798
690,"prof here.

unfortunately, it's complicated and perpetuating series of historical happenings... i'm oversimplifying/generalizing here, and it's likely tldr.

going to college was once a sign of accomplishment/affluence. 

almost all parents yearned for their kids to go to college to better themselves and land better jobs.

for a while it was basically guaranteed that going to college would get you paid more.

more people went to college. higher ed industry grew. you start to see more for-profit colleges with easier access and bigger promises. 

more colleges fighting for students to buy in. standards lowered. entry is easier. finding money to go gets easier, but more devious.

parents expect their kids to go to college as a normal occurrence. many students feel they have to go. higher ed gets saturated and financially prosperous. 

having a college degree isn't special in the workplace anymore. harder for recent grads to stand out in a crowded job market. 

big economic crash.

recently graduated students start to realize that all that free money wasn't actually free. crippling debt on top of economic downturn. 

major life events postponed - buying a home, having kids...

the debt and impact on lives causes people to question the value of education.  is it worth all the debt and despair?

higher ed industry sees the questioning and doubles down on making college easier to get into by further lowering standards both to get in and to stay in. 

for many educators, academic rigor is forcibly replaced by the ""customer is always right"" academia, fueled by bottom lines.

the value of higher ed is questioned even more due to even lower standards and further economic problems. 

online education grows as a cheaper alternative to residential education. many start to see this as the better choice. you start to see questionable value, online-only, take your money and run colleges pop up.

value questioned even more.

big problem incoming. in no small part due to economic downturn, people are having fewer children. this translates into fewer college-age students available. that cliff is coming. 

colleges need to pivot to being even more accessible to start relevant and competitive in the saturated market. ""everything's flexible and negotiable"" in higher education. we need to cater to our customer's needs and wants.

pandemic hits. shit gets real. it affects us horribly. all of us, students, staff, faculty... life gets really hard for a lot of people.

pandemic forcibly accelerates online education on colleges. do or die. academics now cater to the individual needs of each student. ultimate flexibility and unrestricted ""understanding"" becomes the norm. 

we're all going through some stuff. everyone - rightfully so - tries to take it easier on each other. everyone gets an a because of the situation.

we got used to netflix, doordash, zoom... never leaving the house but having everything on-demand. consume. i bet i can be a content creator. look it up on youtube.  what do i even need college for?

we all physically come back from the time away, but some of us never truly come back. we like it easier. we still got graded/paid the same for doing less. i don't want to go to work. can't i just...

post-pandemic, the economy changed. things are more expensive. 

but we still want it our way, immediately, and as cheaply as possible.

higher ed has a money problem. no one wants to pay sticker prices for college. more financial aid! make entry simpler. cater! pander! satisfy! retain!

education, served like burger king: have it your way. give them what they want when they want it. do it all, now. yesterday. anticipate every individuals' needs. give them everything you have, day and night.

but cut costs everywhere.  resources dwindling. incoming classes are smaller. is the ship sinking? faculty leaving for higher-paying jobs. 

admin not replacing them to lower the budgets. spread the work around to the rats left on the ship. oh but there's no additional pay. no, we can't do raises this year. for the good of the cause!

faculty: what am i doing?

student: why should i care? 

staff: please don't fire me. 

parent: why does my child have an f?

administration: what can we do to pass this student?

and now here we are. education is kinda fucked up. 

it's a product of us. we did this.

there are a lot of good, honest, passionate, hard-working people on every side of this - students, staff, faculty, admin. great people that actively resist the generalizations i put forth here. 

but there's so many who have given in to bottom-line, basic, burger king education.  for some, it's the only way they survive. for others, it's just easier.

i'm not sure how we figure this one out, if we do. maybe it needs time. maybe better economics. but here's where we are.",0.03059950306810523
