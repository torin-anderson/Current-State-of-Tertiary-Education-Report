Intended major: some business major and some bio-adjacent major. 

**Boston College**

BC Pros:

- In my favorite city in America
- Boston is a booming biomedical research hub, and that's the sector I want to go into
- Excellent financial aid, my most affordable private option (~$22k/yr)
- Very highly ranked compared to my other options
- Beautiful campus and excellent amenities
- Smaller and more personable
- I was admitted to the business school and have the opportunity to double major

BC Cons:

- Still my more expensive option of the two
- Jesuit, and I'm not religious
- Fairly preppy
- 2000 miles from family and friends

**ASU**

ASU Pros: 

- Full tuition scholarship due to national merit award
- Only paying for housing and meal plan, so about ~$13k/yr, then less when I'm not paying for a meal plan
- Warm weather!
- Amazing Honors College
- Very pretty city

ASU Cons:

- Still 900 miles from family and friends
- HUGE. Hard to feel like it's a personal experience.
- Not as highly ranked.",2024-04-08 12:28:57
90,t1_kyte1eu,1712691864.0,"I would say go to BU., while 22k is a lot, you can work part-time to make up for most of that tuition, since its a better school, your refund on your money will also be better, and it will give u more exposure to better opportunities, especially a bigger place like Boston, than compared to a state like Arizona. Hope this helps :)",2024-04-09 15:44:24
91,t1_kyva6lh,1712717364.0,"I'd go ASU. At the end of your college journey, that BC debt is gonna be crushing. Boston may be a biomedical hub, but Tempe, AZ is a decent city with plenty of job opportunities, and you can always move to Boston after completing college to work there. If you don't have a strong personal preference for Boston over Arizona, I think Arizona is the better bet. That said, I'm just a high school senior trying to figure this stuff out too, so I'm no expert.",2024-04-09 22:49:24

93,t1_kzhj45u,1713066933.0,"**University of Oxford, Corpus Christi College**

PPE (Politics, Philosophy, Economics) Major

Oxford Pros:

* Get to study abroad
* Cheaper, but can afford both
* Get my degree in 3 years
* Very bikeable/walkable city
* Tutorial system with most of learning done 1:2 with professors
   * Also makes it much more academically intense, which I would probably enjoy more
* Can travel a lot across Europe between terms
* Much better college food (especially vegetarian food)

Oxford Cons:

* Couple hours outside of London
* Extracurriculars are not at intense as in US unis
* Studying PPE so not exactly International Relations
* Mostly cloudy

**Georgetown, School of Foreign Service**

Georgetown Pros:

* Get to study International Relations specifically
* Can still study abroad somewhere if I want
* Would learn a language for my degree
* Located in DC which is optimal for internships/networking

Georgetown Cons:

* Probably wouldn't get pushed academically
* Will likely not eat the healthiest",2024-04-13 23:55:33

95,t1_kzp2q9k,1713197180.0,"UW Madison CS vs Purdue Engineering

Purdue

Pros

* highly ranked engineering
* farther from home
* indianapolis speedway is right nearby! (love indycar and it would be really fun to go to an indy 500)
* companies (particularly the one my dad works at) often have conferences/expos here
* seems to be more academically rigorous (from what I've heard)

Cons

* mid weather
* don't love the city of west lafayette or indiana in general haha
* worried there is less of a social/party scene

Madison

Pros

* decent CS program
* in state tuition
* good party/social scene!
* i really like madison as a city

Cons

* mid-to-terrible weather (I guess I am used to it though...)
* too close to home
* worried that I will run into people from HS here :/ and i will have to pretend idk them
* not the biggest fan of the campus itself (purdue is prettier imo)

  
most important factors are probably career connections and environment",2024-04-15 12:06:20
96,t1_kzt5wir,1713263238.0,"Intended major - Computer science

International student

**University of British Columbia (UBC** **Vancouver)** - Bachelor of Science  (QS ranking by subject - 26)

Pros :

* Less intimidating than waterloo, not as cut throat or toxic from what I've heard
* First year science is common and specilisation from second year so there's flexibility
* coop is optional and can be chosen from second year
* great city, good weather
* Tution is much lesser than at waterloo

Cons :

* Not as reputed as waterloo in the tech industry
* Might not get into compsci in second year (not guaranteed)
* Coop program ubc&lt;uwaterloo
* More research oriented and apparently not as good for ug computer science as it is for pg??

**University of Waterloo -** Honours Computer Science Coop  (QS ranking by subject - 21)

Pros :

* Highly ranked, one of the best coop programs, waterloo branding
* Directly accepted into computer science program
* Get up to 2 yrs of working experience and help pay some of the tuition during the work terms

Cons :

* Very competitive, toxic environment, everyone's aiming for FAANG
* Cs students are not even seen out of their dorms (social life is almost non existent)
* Hard to get in and even harder to stay
* coop makes it hard to have friends since people move every 4 months
* tuition is unbelievably high and extra costs during coop in terms of rent and fees
* finding a job during work term not guaranteed, extra year for coop

Honestly, I'm stuck and it's such a hard decision. Both are good unis but waterloo is higher in terms of prestige and employability but ubc is a much more welcoming and holistic environment. Is it worth paying about 70k cad at waterloo when coop is not even guaranteed or pay much lesser at ubc? I'll work hard wherever I go but I do wanna make some friends. ngl I'm willing to grind thru the 5 yrs at waterloo but tuition is expected to increase every yr and its only worth it if I get a coop job which everyones vying for and will thus be extremely difficult. idk I researched, I tried, now I'm sad and even more indecisive. Pls help me make a decision.",2024-04-16 06:27:18

* Amazing co-ops and internships

I'm planning on majoring in Economics (Corporate finance ) or Law (Corporate Law) and I still need to pay for business/law school but I'm worried about my chances of getting selected for internships and making it into law/business school later competition

Bates

* economics is one of the popular majors but I'm worried I won't get enough support
* people at the school really love it there

-more affordable for my family

* maine is a bigger than Vermont
* sh0otings in Lewiston :((

Middlebury

* amazing alumni network
* economics major is one of the best
* rich preppy kids (good for connections)
* higher ranked/ recognised
* their social media has me kinda hooked :/

I was leaning more towards Middlebury because of its array of services but Bates seems like an offer I can't pass down, 30K a year for my parents is going to be a strain but their both so similar and so different I don't know what to choose. I also have to think about uni for my sibling and I'm in a a dilemma :((( (Is it possible to re-appeal the financial aid for Middlebury? )

Any insights please ?????",2024-04-19 12:29:11

118,t1_l0haw39,1713635433.0,"58% chance to move from bottom fifth income to top fifth income. Seems great to me. That looks like a golden ticket to me. 

Also, the major your major in + the work you put in matters more. A school name will (generally) only get you so far. 

And from my personal experience, those who come from more affluent parents tend to be better educated, etc. (due to the advantages). Those students tend to do well in college which might make those without strong academic foundations to lose courage/motivation. 

Anyways, the biggest issue is upbringing when it comes to choosing majors. Upper middle income class kids are more likely to want to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc. while lower income class kids are more likely to want to become teachers, social workers, etc. 

I also noted from my own experience (anecdotes here, not statistics) that many from the lower income families tended to major in fields like social sciences, zoology, African American studies, etc. and did not pursue grad school. Friends I know from upper middle class almost all unanimously went for fields like biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, computer science, pre-med, physics, etc. In fact it was quite funny how one of my friends tried to ""help"" during first year of college by trying to cement the idea of ""you need money to survive. You need to change majors to something more practical."" The peers from lower income families didn't seem to care about money as much as they were more focused on ""helping the poor"" (which I found ironic in some sense as the best way to help the poor is to get your family out of the lower income class first).

Major/degree has more impact than anything else and there tends to be a difference in the preference of certain fields by different ethnic groups and social classes (again all just results of upbringings).

Anyways to your question? Yes. 58% chance to move to top fifth income from bottom fifth? Heck yes.

The family income numbers clearly show Harvard has many fewer “poor”students, so a much lower percentage is even possible.

I’m guessing “percentage of students with under 1000 SAT scores that are employed at graduation” is also much higher at MVS. Because Harvard would be 0% as it has no students entering with SAT scores under 1000. Does 0% mean it’s a complete failure at students getting jobs?

&amp;#x200B;

The median income of a MVS graduate at age 34 is $24,900.

The median income of a Harvard graduate at age 34 is $81,500.

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s actually compare similar populations:

The average income percentile **of a poor student** graduating from Harvard is 71st.

The average income percentile **of a poor student** graduating from MVS is 44th.

&amp;#x200B;

The income numbers indicate the average poor student is much more successful (measured by income, as you seem to define it) graduating from Harvard.

MIT would be my top choice for grad school, and I don’t really like the idea of staying at one school for undergrad AND grad school (8-10 yrs).

I want to have an undegrad where I’m not surrounded solely by STEM folks and where people are generally happy + collaborative (rather than cutthroat competitive). I’d also like a decent size queer population (which IK MIT does have so if anyone has insight for Princeton ur muucchh appreciated)

We have a joke that we’re the knock-off version of Brown (and I guess it’s partially true). But Rochester students are just as capable and just as smart. 

Like Brown, we have an open curriculum. We have a top BA/BS-MD combined program. Both our medical schools are similar too, similarly ranked. Great research and opportunities. Lots of students go to great medical and graduate schools. I guess size is similar too, though UR has 1000-1500 less undergrads.

RE being too stupid: you were admitted. The AOs have said over and over again that they do not make mistakes. You're not too stupid :). As for being burned to a crisp: this may be true, but, if you are, it's because absolutely everyone at MIT is getting burned to a crisp as well.

For context, I am a low income student that is thinking of applying to biomed/biotech for future research, but I am still keeping my options open for public health,etc. I have so fortunate to get into both, but it's been the hardest decision to make. 

Northwestern was my dream school, but I received my financial aid package and compared to Cornell and Harvard's 100% need, it doesn't compare at all. I would be in debt that I don't want to be in, where going to Cornell and Harvard would literally make my debt 0 straight out of college. Also, my parents have only heard about Harvard and are pushing me to go there just because. 

I had heard horror stories about Harvard's engineering program, but I loved Cambridge's environment and close proximity to Boston and its many engineering companies. I also don't know how much their program changed based on how new its engineering building is and its new changes to cross-registration at MIT. However, it doesn't have many engineering clubs that I saw compared to Cornell and Northwestern. 

For Cornell, I am planning to visit soon, but my main breaking point was how it was not near a city and the harsher weather. 

For Northwestern I am in the process for appealing my financial aid package, but I'm not sure if its better for me to commit even with the tuition in mind or if I should just attend Cornell or Harvard. I am in love with their engineering societies and their research facilities, but I've been in such a frenzy trying to figure out where I should go. 

Any input is helpful! Thank you!

The reason why my parents want me to commute is because my parents are immigrants and they don’t care about the social aspect of college. They’ll think that dorm life will turn me into an alcoholic party animal and they think it’s a waste of money. 

The main thing I’m really scared of that I’ll have a tough time forming CLOSE relationships and bonds with other students, and I’ll feel really lonely and left out from everyone. I know there are clubs and stuff, but the clubs meet during the evening and I’m not comfortable driving in the evening hours with those good old aggressive Massachusetts drivers. 

I’ve tried telling them that I am a female, im barely 5 feet tall, so I’m an easy target for danger in Boston. I’ll be too tired commuting every single day. but they still don’t care. 

Sorry about the rant. What are ways that I can convince them to let me stay on a campus? If you can’t think of anything for that question, how do I form close or life-long relationships with other ppl as a commuter? 

Edit: my older brother went to this school was able to get a VERY nice well-paid job fairly quickly after graduation, so understandably my parents are obsessed with this school. he commuted all 4 years of college but he literally has no friends now (he made friends, but wasn’t close to any of them). I don’t think it bothers him, but I personally can’t imagine myself in this situation. I’m cooked aren’t I? 

2nd edit: I see a bunch of replies saying that I don’t need permission from them, but here’s the thing: my parents are paying for my tuition. 

I know I’m very much privileged and I am thankful for them to be paying when so many parents choose not to.

**Boston University**

BU Pros:

* Prestigious
* Boston is a booming tech industry
* Better ranked compared to my other options (#34 in the nation for best engineering schools, #43 in best national universities, #25 in Best Value Schools, #20 in Most Innovative Schools, etc. - according to US News)
* Beautiful campus and excellent amenities
* More academic freedom (i.e. easier to switch majors than a public school)
* Smaller student-to-faculty ratio (11:1)

BU Cons:

* A bit too expensive for my family (tuition + fees can amount to at least 90k a year, no financial aid offered)
* Far from home (I'm in CA), so I have to restart my life in a completely new place
* More rigorous 
* Not as much of a ""campus feel"" (the campus is buildings on a very long street)

**SJSU**

SJSU Pros:

* 7k scholarship, so I only have to pay around 1k a year in tuition
* I get to remain at home so I save on housing fees
* Very connected to tech companies in Silicon Valley (that's what it's mainly known for), and many companies hire from SJSU, and many internships/research opportunities are available 
* Less rigorous (I come from a hypercompetitive high school so this is nice)
* More of a ""campus feel"" (more of a traditional college campus rather than a street)
* Ranked #8 for Electrical/Electronic/Communications Engineering at schools where doctorate degrees are not offered, #3 in Most Innovative Schools, #14 in Best Value Schools, #4 in best regional universities in the West, etc. - according to US News

SJSU Cons:

* Larger student-to-faculty ratio (24:1), more difficult to connect with professors due to large classes
* Less academic freedom (i.e. usually difficult to switch to another major)
* Competitive course selection (it is difficult to get the classes you want sometimes)

**Other options are other Purdue campuses other than the main campus, but I'm not convinced to go if it's not the main campus, unless if you guys have a differing opinion.**

i have realized i wanted to go to the US for college, maybe from the beginning of this school year because i wanted to give myself a challenge. it was originally just a goal for myself but i started doing more extracurriculars and since then, i have barely spent anytime on anything i would like to do. no socializing, no hobbies. i worry about not being able to go to a school in the US despite the time spent, and just end up going to a school in canada like the rest of my classmates. classmates as in those who are enjoying their highschool life with friends and have no worries about meeting expectations of international US unis.

to make things worse, i have a friend in the same art program who has the same goals, same sports, same hobbies, same everything. before this goal, i have never really learned much about her and her same goal of going to the US. she is a person that keeps everything to herself, i would say, and you would have never known how much things she was doing outside of school. ever since i confirmed my goal and also learned that she has the same goal, i started paying more attention to her and i have not been able to get out of the habit of comparing. for example, she have started a sport i have been doing a lot later than me and is doing much better now. she has self studied many aps while im starting my first few this year and im struggling hard. she seems to know all the contests and programs and opportunities before me. i am really trying my best to keep on track with what i need to be do but i cannot control myself to not be influenced. i have multiple classes with her everyday and it just seems endless. one day she told me shes applying for this media position at a prestigious summer programs that she had never told me she was accepted to. i had a breakdown and the rest of my day goes on to think about how none of my summer programs worked out the way i wanted to even though i spent my whole winter on it.

the problem with all of this is, she is one of my closet friends. i have thought about cutting her out but it is nearly impossible because we will be in the same art class for 4 years and have same friend group. we became friends beginning of highschool i enjoyed talking to her about our similar interests and our personalities but recently, those conversations leads to fucking breakdowns because i cant stop thinking about my future. it feels that her future is so planned out and straightforward while mine is a literal spaghetti and i am wasting my time guessing what shes going to do next :(

i know to some this sounds very immature, like maybe i just have to accept the fact that i really am worse than her. but i have always been the accomplished girl to my other friends before she appeared. i was the one with the good grades and lots of friends. i have been holing up in my room because i cant find interest in anything i found before. every time i try to have fun, i think about how i could be working and using this time to pass her.

i dont know what to do. i have been at my lowest for a long time and i cant seem to figure out how to stop worrying about the future and trying to predict what shes going to do next and sincerely have fun for once. i really appreciate you reading my rant until this point, i have tried talking to my parents and they even considered to transfer me to another school. please let me know what i should do, any tips i will listen to.  :)))))",2024-04-21 02:25:37

I found some of the closest friends I'll ever meet and even the love of my life who is graduating from there in a month. It was a sad goodbye to the school but I felt ready to move on.

I ended getting my wish and went to a top 3 school in my field out of state at another private school. Man was that atmosphere different. I don't even know how to describe it to people. The classes were easy for me but the intensity of the school just really affected me to the point I ended up getting sent to the hospital.

What is the best laptop for college in an IS/IT/Cybersecurity Track ?   

Let's ignore makes &amp; models and identify requirements first:  

* You want an enterprise-class, or business-class product and NOT a consumer-product.  
 - Consumer products are designed to sit on a desk and not move for the majority of their life-expectancy.  
 - Enterprise products are designed to be moved and used every single day by people who earn their living using the device.  
* You want a CPU that is fully supported by Windows 11 that offers at least 4 threads.  
 - Anything less than 4 threads is going to represent a performance concern for a lot of software titles.  
 - There needs to be hardware TPM on the motherboard to appease Windows 11.  
* You want at least 16GB of RAM.  
 - This is a sweet spot in price / performance.  
 - More RAM is always nice. But don't buy a 64GB monster laptop just because you can afford it.  
 - 16GB, 24GB, 32GB are all perfectly fine and valid configurations.  
* You want at least 1TB of internal, primary storage, and it needs to be an NVMe SSD.  
 - Your primary Windows install will probably be happy with 256-512GB of space allocated to it.  
 - MS-Office (M365) will go on the Windows install, along with software tools for various projects.  
 - You're going to want at least one Linux VM or a dual-boot partition. That's 64 to 128GB for light to moderate tinkering, and 256GB for more focused usage.  
* You will be well-served with a 1080p display. Spending more on 2K or 4K is not necessary.  
 - Any screen size from 13"" to 15.6"" is fine.  
 - I find the 14"" form-factor to be ideal.  
 - 17"" and 19"" gaming monsters are discouraged - but you do you.  


Reminder: business/enterprise class laptops can be easily opened up using a small torx screwdriver so you can upgrade the RAM, SSD and replace the battery yourself.  

So, buying a model with a 512GB SSD by default, and adding a 4TB monster later is a valid purchasing decision.  

I am a Lenovo ThinkPad bigot.  

I acknowledge that Dell Latitude and XPS are perfectly valid devices.  
I further acknowledge that HP EliteBook is also a valid product.  

But I like ThinkPads.  

Not ThinkBook. Not IdeaPad. Those are trash.  

The ThinkPad T-series is the mainstream workhorse issued to thousands of working professionals all over the place.  
The ThinkPad X-series is the slightly lighter and thinner version for those who prioritize lightweight mobility over performance.  
The ThinkPad P-series is the heavyweight workstation replacement for those who need horsepower and are prepared to carry a heavier device to get it.  

The ThinkPad L-series is a value or budget focused device that I don't recommend, but others may have more positive experiences with.  
The ThinkPad E-series are the same as the L-series. Too many cost-cutting decisions.  
The ThinkPad Yoga family are usually laptop/tablet convertibles that I also do not recommend.

I plan on doing the pre-med track, so I’d be applying to med school in a few years. The thing is, which college should I choose? Out of the ivies, one of them is giving me a pretty good deal and I wouldn’t have to pay so much for the first year alone; however, for the private university, I got a full ride for the full four years of undergrad. Another thing not mentioned is that my parents income increased DRASTICALLY (now above 100k), so I’m afraid that if I commit to an ivy, the financial aid packet won’t be as much the following year whereas I’m covered no matter what for the private university.",2024-04-21 09:20:07

I was super lucky to get into Harvard, but financial aid came back and we’d have to pay full price, which would be somewhat of a burden on my family (not a 100% deal-breaker but definitely a factor). Also, after Visitas last weekend and a second visit this week (I live within driving distance lol), I didn’t really love the campus or Cambridge. I also worry about the competitiveness of clubs and classes, the pretty underwhelming (tbh pretty bad) quality of dorms/gym/other facilities, and how the campus isn’t too centralized and is so intertwined with the city. But obviously Harvard feels like something that’s really hard to pass up on, though I’m not 100% sold on why.

On the other hand, I got into UMiami with a full scholarship and got into a pretty cool honors program there (which pretty much means I get my general education requirements waived, giving me really great academic freedom as well as priority class registration and a few other perks). I also really loved the campus and modern facilities, plus the academics, resources, and opportunities there seem pretty legit. I also definitely like the school spirit vibe on campus. Also with my scholarship I could study abroad for no additional cost and I could get a Master’s only paying for like one semester. 

For context UM is a lot further from home (which is lowkey a pro and a con cuz I wanna spread my wings a little). I also don’t really know what I want to study/major in, but I definitely want to study abroad and probably want to double/triple major (both of which will be a lot easier at UM esp with honors program). I also think grad school is likely in my future so there’s that.

So they're less likely to be rich.

That doesn't mean their education failed to uplift them; on the contrary, it gave them access to realms of human knowledge they couldn't have afforded to explore at most other institutions and gave them the sense of security (in terms of generous financial aid and the power of the Harvard name) to pursue their true passions and interests in and beyond university.

If you have no idea what you want to study, maybe Miami is the better choice for you, since from what you say, the only reason attracting you to Harvard is the name.

I do get the feeling that Harvard is great if you can get hooked in socially, somehow.  It seems very clubby, money talks, and if you don't have a particular interest, talent, or religious/ethnic group, something that gives you a way in, you can wind up socially isolated.  But really, it's like that anywhere else, too, but at Harvard, the way into the social clubs is often by getting invited by upper classmen in those clubs whom you knew in your exclusive prep school,  who were themselves invited in by their older prep school classmates, whose older brothers and fathers and grandfathers and great grandfathers and so on were in those clubs.  You can find your group through clubs for your own religious or ethnic group, or via clubs for your own special interests.

The freshman dorm experience of living in the Yard comes with community, but some of the rooms are tiny, and there are rats, mice, and roaches in some of the buildings.  The food is pretty bad.  The quality of housing in the houses for upperclassmen is better, but some of the dorms are sort of far from the main campus (the former Radcliffe dorms), plus because students can and do apply for housing in relatively large groups, it promotes a cliquish environment.

As for academic competition - that's only if you're in a field that has quantifiable criteria, such as a STEM field.  Harvard is filled with students admitted via criteria other than standardized testing, who wind up majoring in ""soft"" fields, such as Sociology or some form of ethnic studies.",2024-04-21 11:10:07

498,t1_l0m17ab,1713715699.0,"It feels to me like the main explanation is the kids here disproportionately come from places where there is not necessarily a very deep understanding of the US higher education system and the roles that different sorts of undergrad programs play in that system.  So, the most famous private research universities are (relatively) popular here because they are the few US universities really well known where they are coming from, and most of the many great private standalone colleges and public research universities in the US are relatively unpopular with them because those institutions are relatively unknown where they are coming from.

And then the people here with a broader understanding of the US higher education system will try to expand their horizons, but they sometimes get defensive and rationalize that artificially narrow way of seeing higher education in the US through the concept of ""prestige"" (even though most of the value-added benefits people claim will come from attending a more ""prestigious"" undergrad do not hold up to any sort of reasonably-controlled empirical scrutiny).  Or maybe they want to believe in the broader view themselves, but then they get negative feedback from family or peers, and they grow concerned again.  And so on.

But I agree, if you are from the US and know a lot of engineers, and the question is asked why would a kid who wants to study engineering want to go to Purdue or Georgia Tech, the answer would be, ""Because they are Purdue and Georgia Tech!""  Meaning people with that level of familiarity with engineering programs in the US know those are two of the top engineering powerhouses in the US, and no more explanation is needed.

So yes, it was a bit surprising to me when I saw people seriously wondering about such engineering programs, but then I figured out that many of the kids here just are not all that familiar with US higher education, and are struggling to deal with family and peers who are similarly not well-informed.",2024-04-21 12:08:19

**UMass Amherst**

UMass Pros:

* Good/Safe location, nice towns
* Somewhat near Boston, strong tech hub
* Very highly ranked in CS compared to Binghamton
* Beautiful campus
* Pretty close to home
* Good career fairs

UMass Cons:

* Price - $41k after scholarship/aid - More expensive than in-state tuition
* Larger classes than Binghamton
* Very liberal, seems like there is not much diversity of political opinion
* I'm not much of a party person

**Binghamton University**

Binghamton Pros:

* In-state tuition \~$29k, possibly around $20k with NYS STEM scholarship (would need to work in state for 5 years after graduating for that to apply)
* Smaller classes, especially in the major
* Good academics all around
* Already know some friends going here
* Beautiful campus
* Pretty close to home
* I have relatives close by that I could visit

Binghamton Cons:

* Not the best location, not extremely safe of a town
* Not really near any tech hubs or good location for jobs
* Slightly lower ranked in CS compared to other options

**Purdue University**

* Large school, may be hard to feel like a personal experience
* Location is just okay, not much around
* Very far from home
* Very little opportunity for dorming - I would like to have the opportunity to dorm for multiple years

Here are my current standings:

Fordham gave me their Fordham Scholarship, which covers tuition for 8 semesters of study and I'm anticipating \~$20,000 in other scholarships/grants (from the net price calculator). So essentially I'll be paying next to nothing to attend Fordham (fingers crossed), which is awesome. I applied as a marketing major (probably gonna switch out to something else, idk what) which is ranked #10 in undergrad programs. It's around a 3 hour drive from my home so I won't be too far or too close, and it's in NYC which should have great opportunities to find internships/network within the industry. Plus, I LOVE the city and I could definitely see myself living there. I'm mainly concerned about their required core curriculum, which I've heard is lengthy (required 2 religion, philosophy, and theology classes), their dining hall food (which gives people food poisoning) and the location (the Bronx is infamous for being dangerous). Also, if I were to ever decide to switch my major to something besides business, Fordham isn't a great school (compared to UMD) for anything else.

UMD Smith is a great business school and I would also have free tuition on top of being an in-state student (parent works for UMD). I was invited to their Scholars Program, specifically the Media, Self, and Society (MSS) program, and I was accepted to Smith as an info-sys major (ranked #6 in undergrad programs)!

There are countless posts from HS students who completed 10+ AP classes and applied to a T20.

If you've earned a HS diploma/associates degree at the same time and applied to a T20, what were your results?

553,t3_1c9nb0d,1713720066.0,"I’m a San Francisco high school senior trying to determine whether to deposit at Carleton or Colby. 

It seems that for every one thing I like about Colby, there’s an equally relevant thing I don’t care for as much, and the same goes for Carleton. For context, I originally EDed to Middlebury, which still remains, in my mind, a much better fit than either of these schools. 

Here is my dilemma: Colby checks more boxes for me, but the boxes that Carleton checks hold so much weight that I’m not sure I should ignore them. 

A bit more about me: I am very outdoorsy, and growing up near the coast has been a large part of my upbringing; I love to swim and sail just as much as I love challenging hikes. I hope to study Molecular Biology and Data Science (Colby has both, Carleton has neither) but would settle for Biology and Computer Science if I had to. It seems like Colby has more robust options within their Biology and Mathematical Sciences departments, but I know that the quality of education I would receive at Carleton would be pretty unbeatable. 

I would prefer trimesters, but I’ve heard from Carleton students that it makes it very challenging to study abroad (a non-negotiable for me) and there are fewer programs I would be able to choose from in order to comply with the Carleton schedule. With that, I know there comes the benefit of the externship program, but they also mentioned that overachieving students (like myself) tend not to do as well in externship placement because they want to give other students opportunities to fill out their resumes, too. This is worrisome to me. In Colby’s case the 4-1-4 acts nearly the same as the extended winter break at Carleton, minus the 3-week externship program.

I’m also not a big partier, and am concerned about that being a barrier to entry into the Colby social scenes, but I have wanted to be in New England since I began touring colleges my junior year. I LOVE Colby’s campus and the teachers seemed very knowledgeable when I spoke to them. Boston and SF are both hubs for development in the STEM I am interested in, so it would be great to gain access to both networks since I hear a lot of Colby families come from Massachusetts. In terms of location, I love the idea of being rural and would prefer a 45-minute drive to a coastal town over a 45-minute drive to the Twin Cities.

We found out-of-state public schools capping those admissions and/or higher stats needed for the desired program. While our best in-state option capped the # of kids coming from son’s high achieving public high school … so lower stats out-of-staters got in. Many of the privates don’t cap by major so that didn’t play into their admissions policies. I know they can still cap by location but the further you go from your home the less that’s an issue. Our in-state flagship told everyone at an admissions event that if you met their basic requirements for admissions you’d get in to the school even if you didn’t get into the major (CS) and could then work toward trying to get into major. Then mid process they changed the policy and then capped the program AND capped kids coming from certain places. We just felt lied to. Personally I sort of hate them all.

570,t3_1c9nn4z,1713720941.0,"Hey everyone! I'm in quite a bit of dilemma currently with my top options. I received the full-ride Robertson Scholarship to Duke which allows me to cross-enroll at UNC Chapel Hill for a semester. However, I was also fortunately admitted to Harvard, Stanford, Yale w/ Hahn Scholarship (research funding), and the Wharton School at UPenn. 

For some background, I am a North Carolina native but I attend a private boarding school in the Northeast. I hope to play Division 1 Football and have received a preferred walk-on offer (PWO) to Duke &amp; Stanford which means that I have a roster spot but will not be on athletic scholarship. I was also offered by Harvard, Yale, and UPenn to play D1 Football but the Ivy League doesn't offer full-ride athletic scholarships. 

I wanted some thoughts on my current state of mind: 

Right now, Duke is my top choice for college, but I'm fine with attending any of the 5 schools as I can pursue playing football and majoring in CS/Econ. The full ride Robertson merit scholarship mixed with the ability to play football at a Division 1 Power 5 FBS school would be a dream come true (as well as being close to home). I haven't received my aids offers from Harvard, Stanford, Yale, or Wharton but with the financial aid calculator, my EFC is \~45k to 55k per year. I know whatever school I chose, I will have access to great opportunities.

Career-wise, I want to go into High Finance (Investment Banking or Private Equity) in New York after graduation and hopefully pivot into Venture Capital in Cali or NC. I want to eventually come back to the Research Triangle Park (RTP) area in my late 20's or early 30's and create my own startup venture in the biotech space. My end goal is that I want to build generation wealth whether it may be investments in startups, real estate, etc.  

What I look for in a college is a collaborative environment, fun social scene, and great for entrepreneurship and finance/tech. I don't want anything too intense academically - I'm looking for a good balance of academics and college life.

575,t1_l0mgmfa,1713721079.0,"I'm a professor at a large public state flagship university. It's great in many ways, and offers a ton of opportunities to students from around the world. I would not hesitate at all to send most anyone here, particularly if they are seriously concerned about cost. We have resources and facilities and an excellent faculty in almost all major fields (and in many non-major ones). But the practical realities of public universities also mean that it's fraught with politics, budgetary concerns, research demands, and size constraints that make its mission a little different than many smaller private schools that are tailored to their undergraduate education. It's also quite a different living and learning environment than one might get at a small liberal arts college, or even a private research university.

This is part of the reason that I'm spending ten times more (!!) to send my son to a small liberal arts college rather than have him head up the street to go to school here.

It's easy to chalk this up to prestige whoring, but I think instead it's about what his educational experience is going to be and what will put him on the best footing to be a lifelong learner. Hard to say, ultimately, what will do that for a person, but there are at least some reasons to think that it's harder to find one's footing in a large population of students with slightly less ambitious aspirations. 

Many of my colleagues feel the same way, and I can look at our local HS Instagram page to see that many kids of the professoriate are not ending up at our public university, despite how inexpensive it would be for us. (Some, I will say, are going to other state flagships, but many are going to private colleges and universities.)

I would be fibbing if I denied that prestige isn't also a factor, though prestige and reputation come in a variety of guises, and it is crucial to disentangle what makes one school prestigious over another. Berkeley, for instance, is prestigious because it produces a lot of top rank research. Do most undergraduate students brush elbows with this? Often not. Harvard is also prestigious because it produces a lot of top rank research, but also because it's old and has a lot of resources. Do undergraduates brush elbows with this research? Much more often, though still, less than you might think. (Why? Among other reasons, it has more money.) Dartmouth and Brown are prestigious for their research and their teaching, and they are also old and wealthy. They provide a great environment for their undergrads, and faculty can direct their attention to the education of those undergrads. Williams, Amherst, and Swarthmore are prestigious mostly for their teaching, but also because they're old and well-endowed, much of which also positions undergraduates well. 

These are all tradeoffs, and public education is a wonderful thing, but it is also not all roses. At this historical juncture, it is also challenged by nefarious political forces that sometimes make it harder to do and say things.

For pic 3: I dont get the meaning of it like for example its saying that I20 will be issued by university on these factors or I would have to fill any one of them

The first thing you need to understand about admissions to colleges and universities is that you need to come to it with an open mind, so that you can have a balanced list.

I had a great experience but my brother will tell you he was pretty miserable as he never really found his people and is ideologically conservative. The dorms and food were meh and teaching in some classes just so so- many times real teaching was done by grad students and clinical instructors, especially in larger intro type classes though some of these folks were great teachers. Could I have gotten the same or better education elsewhere? Almost certainly yes. My siblings and I were fortunate that our parents gifted us with the ability to graduate without debt but they made a lot of personal sacrifices to do this and we lived very frugally. Would I do it again knowing what I do now if I had to pay full tuition (which has become out of control IMO)? Only if I knew that I was going to choose a career with the ability to pay back those student loans relatively quickly (financial sector) as for most careers you don’t need the Harvard degree to succeed.

If you’re interested in grad school, I know our stats placement is really good, our math less so. As for biology, there’s research available but anecdotally I’ve heard it’s very hard to get.

643,t3_1c9pfom,1713725377.0,"**Intended Major:** Computer Science and Economics (applied for this major where it was offered and for CS only where it wasn't). I'm not sure exactly which career path I want to pursue yet, though I've considered SWE, finance, and policy research (I'm interested in the public policy side of Econ). I also feel like only studying CS/STEM subjects for 4 years would be very dry, so I wanted to keep my options open by intending to major in both fields.

While cost is a large consideration, I also value the complete four-year ""college experience"" and the social life/connections that might bring; if not, I would probably be considering JC only. Some of my pros/cons are just my initial perceptions and may be untrue, so please please **PLEASE** do not hesitate to correct me if I've made any iffy or false claims here, especially if you've been to any of these schools.

**UCLA**

Estimated COA  \~$40k/yr

Pros

* In-state so my cheapest option
* Close to home (1 hour-ish without traffic)
* I already know a good amount of students there, both from this year's class and previous classes
* I've heard the quality of life is better (good dining, people have a better sense of balance)
* Big alumni network? It could just be because I already live in SoCal but I've always thought that UCLA is probably the most ""well-known"" school of these 4 among the general public
* Best overall in sports (not super important to me but going to some games might be fun)

Cons

* Hard to double major in CS and Econ (doable, but probably a lot harder since there's no dedicated program for it)
* May be hard to change majors if I decide CS isn't right for me
* Big state school, so maybe more sink-or-swim/cutthroat than somewhere like Cornell?
* I've heard it can be really lonely/isolating
* You need a car to get around places (even the football stadium is an hour away)
* I want to get out of SoCal after having lived here for 8 years
* SoCal weather (can be nice but I prefer somewhere with 4 seasons since I grew up in Boise)

**Cornell**

Estimated COA \~$83k/yr (haven't gotten aid report back yet but it's likely gonna be $0)

Pros

* It's an Ivy, so it's possibly more prestigious particularly if I want to pursue a field where that matters (finance, maybe even government or law)
* According to my friends the QoL is very high and people are more fun/social
* It's ranked higher for CS than UCLA
* Double majoring and exploring different majors is probably easier
* Strong alumni network, most people I know who went to Cornell are *very* proud of that fact
* I'd probably like the weather/environment more than SoCal (call me crazy)

Cons

* Most expensive by far
* Outside of Ithaca there's nothing to do
* No strong sports teams that interest me
* Seasonal depression (maybe? I'm fine with cold weather and snowy winters)

**Georgia Tech**

Estimated COA \~$52k/yr (Just going off website because aid report not back yet)

Pros

* CS program seems to be top-notch and I always see this sub lauding it
* Cost seems relatively low for an OOS school
* Threads program is really unique and seems more well-developed for any sort of CS specialization
* Different atmosphere/environment in the ATL

Cons

* Cost
* Besides CS/engineering I'm not really sure if other programs are well-developed (especially Econ), so it might be harder to explore other majors
* Atlanta and the Southeast in general can get really humid and muggy
   * This is why people in SoCal like to say ""We have heat but it's a dry heat""

**UIUC**

Estimated COA \~$63k/yr

Pros

* Admitted for Computer Science and Economics, which as a singular major would be much more manageable than double majoring
* Top-ranked CS program that I see many SWEs come from
* Probably the easiest school to explore CS plus other fields I'm interested in

Cons

* Cost
* Kinda in the middle of nowhere

In terms of payment, my parents are willing to pay for tuition but I'd probably have to pay for other cost-of-living expenses myself, which is why I'm wondering if I should go to UC Irvine, which I can commute to (not easily but it's doable) or UC Santa Barbara, where I got the Regents Scholarship.

Atm I'm leaning towards UCLA out of my 4 top options, so I guess my biggest questions here are:

* Is any other school listed here worth paying extra for over UCLA?
* Is UCLA worth paying extra for over Santa Barbara or Irvine?
* As someone who got no aid, should I go to JC for 2 years to save money and then transfer out? Or is there something in four-year universities that's worth paying extra/going into debt for?",2024-04-21 14:49:37

* **Lower Prestige:** Some people associate prestige with private schools, overlooking the excellent academic programs and faculty at public universities.
* **Large Class Sizes:** While some public universities have larger classes, many offer smaller seminars and research opportunities to undergraduates.",2024-04-21 14:53:47
645,t3_1c9pk66,1713725684.0,"Okay, so basically i got accepted into both UofT Rotman Commerce and UGA with an intended major at the Terry College of Business and waitlisted for G-Tech (I find out if I got in after May 15th) but here's why it's so hard for me to decide:

**UofT**

* Pros
   * Near/in the T20 (my goal) 
   * The Rotman Commerce program is REALLY good because it's in the business-y area of Canada (as far as my research goes) and a lot of internship opportunities
   * I really like the location and campus and the Woodsworth college
   * 50k dollar scholarship over 4 years (20k in freshman year then 10k per year)
* Cons
   * It's more expensive than UGA or G-Tech (around 60-65k tuition)
   * Further from home (and because I was recently diagnosed with arthritis, my mom gets worried really fast and easily)
   * Cold weather - again, because of my arthritis being in the cold rlly doesn't help
   * Academically challenging - obviously this is expected, but after these really really hard two last years of HS i'm just not sure if i'm ready to immediately jump into such a competitive environment
   * Social life - although it's in the middle of Toronto and has really good stuff socially, i've heard that the people in the program are really snarky and competitive and just not nice and i also want to be able to enjoy at least my freshman year of college socially because I really wasn't able to do that in my senior year of HS

**UGA**

* Pros
   * Close to home so I can come home every weekend/every 2 weeks
   * I really like the campus
   * The Terry College of Business is really good and there are a lot of internship opportunities with it
   * The environment is a lot more chill so I can enjoy social life more
   * Although i'm still considered an international student and don't get financial aid my freshman year, I'm pretty sure I'll be eligible for the Hope and Zell Miller scholarships from my sophmore year - my senior year (cuts tuition by around 50% so from 40k as an international student to around 15-20k)
* Cons
   * UofT is definitely ranked a lot higher than UGA and therefore wouldn't look as good on my CV as UofT - although it's only undergrad, I do really really want to go to a top school 
   * UofT is my dad's top choice and although he would be really happy and proud of me wherever I go and he said his choice doesn't ultimately matter, I know that UofT would look better on my resume overall

Ultimately, if I do get into Georgia Tech I'll definitely prefer going there over UofT simply because it's a lot closer to home and is still a really good school ranking wise (not that there's anything wrong with UGA and i'm honestly really grateful to have gotten in and i love the social opportunities offered at UGA) but I have to tell UofT my decision by May 1st and G-Tech decisions come out after May 15th...

I also already submitted my deposit to UGA to reserve my seat (this was before I found out I got into UofT I literally found out this week) but I'm just so unsure about everything right now

Additionally, before I found out about UofT, if I wasn't going to get into G-Tech my plan was to really make my resume impressive during my freshman year at UGA so that I could apply to transfer somewhere else (probably apply to the ivies again) if I still really wanted to go to one of them so that's still an option.

I also do plan on getting a masters degree and going to grad school if that helps contexualising things

I'm honestly truly grateful for all the offers I got and the opportunities and the main issues between the two are about their academic reputation (lowkey bragging rights too) but ultimately I just want to be happy wherever I go. Any insight or help would be really appreciated :))",2024-04-21 14:54:44

Major @ Northwestern: Learning and Organizational Change + Economics 

Major @ CMC: PPE or Economics

Career Goal: Business (leaning towards consulting but open to investment banking)

Northwestern pros: 
- Name recognition will lead to more job opportunities down the line (?)
- Big 10 sports (more school spirit + fun games to attend)
- next to Chicago (better for finding business jobs/internships + lots of food, shopping, museums to explore)
- Kellogg Business School (ability to take classes through the Kellogg certificate program + will have an edge if I choose to apply to their MBA program)
- Larger selection of activities/clubs to get involved in
- SESP (my home school) is one if the smallest schools so I will have more one on one help with advisors and get to take smaller classes
- SESP has easier gen ed requirements that I can use AP credits to satisfy
- Quarter system makes it easier to double major

Northwestern cons:
- Weather (I’m from California so the Illinois winters sound really scary to me)
- Much harder to build close relationships with professors + will have to be in larger classes for my Econ major
- Quarter System (more exams—&gt; more stress)
- People make fun of SESP for being easy😭

CMC pros:
- Individualized attention + help from professors and faculty (since each graduating class is only ~350 students)
- Tight knit community (everyone knows each other, always familiar faces around)
- Less people—&gt; more resources available for each student
- Crazy research and summer opportunities that are much more accessible to students (than it would be at a bigger school)
- Weather
- Taking classes at other Claremont colleges
- Close to friends at UCI and home
- Beach + LA are pretty accessible 

CMC cons:
- Kind of a high school feel (the college itself is actually half the size of my high school in terms of # of students)
- Less name recognition (less opportunity for jobs?)
- Everyone knows each other’s business (since there’s such a small amount of people per grade)
- Weak sports
- Kind of like a bubble (most students live on campus all 4 years)
- Yellow fever (?)….one of the current students I talked to mentioned how since the student population is made up of a majority of white people, the fetishization of East Asians is a problem",2024-04-21 15:21:26

I was just to preface this by saying I in no way  want to come off as ungrateful or pretentious, if I do come off as such, I apologize.

I go to a private Catholic school, it’s been a very very rough four years. The school I go to is extremely difficult, and in conjunction with all the work, I’ve had a very tough time socially. I’ve always been viewed as the “smart” kid of my family. Everyone has always expected big things of me, and it’s very draining. I have a very low self esteem because of this, but I’ve still worked very hard throughout high school and ended with high marks (95.77 UW and a 1510). Leaving my public school to go to private school also puts a mark on your head with college apps, because now all the kids you used to go to school with have this idea of you and the school they expect you to attend. Well, college apps have been a fucking nightmare. Everyone at my public school has been KILLING it - Columbia, MIT, Colby, Vassar, Princeton, John’s Hopkins. There are less than 100 kids in the grade and they are doing really well. Now, the same cannot be said about my school. The usual Catholic feeder schools did well per usual - BC, Notre Dame, Fairfield, Georgetown, ect. I was never really interested in those schools, nor was I interested in the high school I am currently attending (sent by parents because they thought it would be better for college :/).

Now, down to the meat and potatoes. I did not do how I was expected to in college apps. I have a nice scholarship to RPI for CS, and got into Northeastern (Oakland transfer) for CS. Now, Northeastern is full price, and I would have to transfer from Oakland, so it’s not practical. I was waitlisted at Carnegie Mellon, Binghamton, UMASS Amherst, and UMich. It looks like I’m going to RPI. It’s not the end of the world, I just feel embarrassed. I feel like everyone expected more of me. I don’t want to tell anyone where I am committing. Whenever anyone searches up RPI, they’re going to see Troy NY and a 65% acceptance rate. I know how much of an egotistical prick I must sound like, I just don’t want to be frowned upon by everyone around me. It’s not worth an extra 50k a year to stroke my ego and go to Northeastern, but man, I wish I could at least be proud or excited of where I am attending. ",2024-04-21 15:27:46

I know I've basically spit out an ad there, but as someone who received help from Matriculate as a high schooler and loved it enough to join back as an advisor when I got to college, I can vouch for the legitimacy and helpfulness of the program on both sides. Check out our website [matriculate.org](http://matriculate.org) and if you like what you see, please encourage your daughter to apply! The app only takes a few minutes and has no essay component.

- advising for people looking into law school

Do you think this is because of the Georgetown name, or because Georgetown admits a set of HS students who, as a group, are more likely to earn good grades, score well on the MCAT, and do the ""other stuff"" that helps one get into medical school?

I suspect it's mostly the latter.  If so, then your \*specific\* odds of being admitted to medical school may not be significantly enhanced by attending Georgetown.

You can’t really look at med school acceptance rate — you’ll get a false positive.

Think about it like this: Does Duke University PRODUCE top NBA prospects, or does Duke University ATTRACT people who were going to be top NBA prospects regardless of where they went to college?

The “top premed schools” are sort of the same; if you Google it you’ll find a list of schools that ATTRACT lots of very smart kids from affluent families — with brains and money being the two most critical factors required of people who end up in medical school — Harvard, Yale, other Ivies, Stanford, Duke, WashU, Georgetown, etc.

That said if pursuing DE may open up more time for maybe some unique other thing (sport, arts, internship, volunteering, etc), that might stand out in admissions.  It's hard to know what a school will value year to year.  Your application should be coherent package and let the chips fall.

Many private colleges may cap the number of AP or DE credits they will take or not take any at all.  Including mid range private schools in our experience.  You really need to investiate ahead of time if you want those credits to count.  Also run a range of net price calculators to make sure anything you spend time on will be affordable for you.

DE is free for qualified students in my state so it is not an uncommon path.  I do know students who have moved on to a state flagship and then graduated in 2 years.

So I applied for 8 schools in total, 4 CSUs and 4 UCs. Due to how California's college system is set up I received admin decisions from all of my CSU picks before hearing back from any of the UCs. Since I was unsure if I even got into any UCs, I decided to make sure I got any and all important files to my CSU picks so that I wouldn't fall behind. It also didn't help that the deadline was May 1st.

Part of this was submitting intent to enroll forms to at least three out of the four CSUs. I want to make it clear right now, I had no clue about the act of double depositing before I did this. No one had mentioned it to me, not even my guidance counselor, so I thought I was doing the right thing by covering my bases.

Flash forward to now and I've been accepted to 3/4 UCs I've applied to (this happened last week). It was today that I was made aware that submitting multiple intent to enroll forms is considered a big no-no and that I may lose out on my acceptances. I'm freaking out about this becuase a) I had no clue. And b) I have no idea what to do? I think I'm supposed to withdraw my acceptances to the surplus CSUs but what if it's too late and the UC's rescind their acceptance decisions anyway?

I'm honestly freaking out, I've emailed my guidance counselor but she isn't in the office until Tuesday. I really have no idea what to do in this situation or how much I've just screwed myself over. If anyone has any advice as to what to do I would greatly appreciate it. ",2024-04-21 16:32:30

My summary: GT has the stronger CS program, but Duke wins in all the non-tangibles.

I've realized that each school will make me grow differently as a person. The academics at GT will continue reinforcing my passion for CS, and the people there will help me share and develop my passion. On the other hand, Duke will make a more well-rounded (yet still passionate) person but without the constant (hyper)competitive bubble of GT. However, it can be argued that one's friends will make the difference at either school. The culture that the school fosters is a crucial aspect of the people that the school ends up attracting.

Frankly, my indecisiveness comes from what I will miss out on. The nerdy culture at GT might be more conducive to fostering opportunities for entrepreneurship. However, Duke might allow me to discover a passion or interest in applied CS that I would've never considered.

My friend who committed to cs at northeastern is more recognized than me, and our friends treat him like the next bill gates even though he literally failed the ap csa exam last year. 

But then I actually visited UIUC (for their admitted CS students tour). The campus is beautiful and all the students talk very highly about their CS program. A lot of them mentioned about how easy it was for them to get internships since UIUC CS is really just that highly regarded which is something that I really wouldn't overlook (especially considering the current state of the CS job market). 

Although I still feel a bit shy in saying I'm committed to UIUC, I feel very happy with this decision. Within a semester of being in UIUC I'm sure we will both stop caring about what the students from our highschools think.",2024-04-21 16:44:28

759,t3_1c9sf3z,1713732833.0,"Hi, so basically I am having problems in choosing which college to choose. Basically in the US I was only accepted into one college worth going and that is Smith College. The problem is  i'm an intended CS major and if I decided to go to Smith I would do a BA in CS and not a BS in CS. I don't see a problem with that but in the workforce i'm sure they would prioritize accepting someone with a BS than a BA.

Also the financial part is crucial, even though I received a scholarship worth $22,500 at Smith, i'm currently i'm facing problems with the FAFSA and i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to receive it. In the other hand I was thankfully selected as an Amazon Future Engineer scholarship recipient but I still haven't received my Smith financial aid package to know how much they are going to give me. Thing that is on me because I haven't fill the non custodial parent waiver.

But if I stay in my homeland I would go to college for free as the Amazon scholarship would cover everything. Now, there's another problem, I was waitlisted at Columbia University. Thing that makes me doubt about if I should commit to Smith or decline my Smith offer and see if I can get off the waitlist for Columbia or just commit to my local univeristy.

I'm from NYC and not much of a frat person (as of right now) but I'm still looking for a decent amount of social life/activity on campus. I got merit from Rochester and Union but more from Union so I'm mainly wondering if Rochester is a better institution for what I'm looking for and deserves the larger tuition.

Rochester pros:

\- The Take 5 program allows an extra year tuition-free to explore outside of major (really interested in this)

\- No gen-ed, allowing for exploration of courses

\- Beautiful campus; loved the library

\- High-ranked engineering

\- I generally liked the vibe the most here when I toured, the students seemed intelligent and nice

\- Emphasis on research (for better or for worse)

Cons:

\- Weather is pretty bad here (though it has tunnels)

\- More expensive than my other options

\- Unsure about how fun the social life here is

\- Farther from home

Union pros:

\- Major flexibility in engineering (double major, study abroad, etc) b/c it's a college, not a uni. 

\- Well ranked engineering

\- Pretty nice campus

\- Amazing attainable research opportunities

Union cons:

\- Higher ratio of students in Greek life and I've heard it dominates campus; not really the social life I'm after

\- Extremely small (\~2,000 total)

\- Surrounding town doesn't really have anything to offer

763,t3_1c9smq0,1713733346.0,"Hello! Long time lurker here :) As the title implies, I was extremely fortunate to be accepted by both UC Berkeley and Johns Hopkins but absolutely cannot decide between the two! (Honestly I’m still totally in shock, I applied to colleges fully expecting to go to either CC or a lower ranked UC!) 

For a little background, I am a California resident, low income so they’re both similar in price (though Berkeley is estimated to be a couple thousand more and I would definitely need to work longer hours), and planning on double-majoring in English and (hopefully) biology. (The double major is far more tentative since it might be too much work for me to handle). I am also intending on going into law post undergrad, ideally at Stanford, Berkeley, UCLA, or USC — being in California for grad school is very important to me!

For specifics, at Hopkins I’d major in Writing Seminars and Molecular and Cell Biology whereas at Berkeley I’d major in English and Molecular and Cell Biology. I love all things theater, film, and generally arts related, so I am hoping to pursue all of those interests at least as hobbies!

Now without further ado, my pros and cons—

Hopkins Pros: 
- everyone there seemed extremely intelligent, mature, focused, and driven
- The school has been incredibly supportive of me - they flew me out to admitted students day, covered my hotel, and truly made me feel welcome! I had no idea an institution could be so, so generous, and I am so grateful for everything Hopkins has already done! 
- Related to the aforementioned, Hopkins has very deep pockets that they are, in my experience, definitely willing to spend on students
- The classes are much more intimate and it is far easier to get closer with professors 
- There seems to be a lot more individualized support (which I would definitely take full advantage of since I already do so in high school with classes under 35 kids!)
- According to the students I spoke to, there is a lot of course flexibility, and double-majoring is quite doable
- The housing is great! 
- Baltimore is much cheaper than Berkeley 
- While small, everyone involved in JHU’s student-led theatre group was incredibly genuine and kind. It was also very flexible with how many hours you could put into productions. 
- The mock trial team seems fantastic!
- There is a Film and Media Studies Major so I could potentially help people out with various projects. 

Hopkins Cons:
- Most people I spoke to were pre-med, so I’m worried I would feel isolated as someone who is pre-law
- I don’t particularly like Baltimore
- The weather. I’m a sunny SoCal girl! 
- It is extremely far from home and due to some complicated family circumstances, I don’t know how manageable a potential emergency flight home might be. 
- There is a foreign language requirement for writing seminars. I have tried and tried to learn a second language, but have never been successful as of now! 
- I have heard rumors of the environment being very competitive and stressful 
- Campus felt kind of sterile 
- Imposter syndrome/I really struggled to picture myself there (though I believe I could overcome this with time) 

Overall, Hopkins was extremely welcoming and supportive. It is a very drastic change from the life I am used to, but I would be surrounded by the best of the best and grow immensely in a new environment. It is a bit more affordable with much nicer amenities, and truly a once in a lifetime opportunity. However, I definitely struggle to picture myself living there, and didn’t feel as if I fully fit in. 


Berkeley Pros:
- I absolutely adore the city. I have always wanted to live somewhere like it! 
- The campus felt very alive (granted this was likely due to it being Cal Day), and there was a ton to do in the surrounding areas (+ I am a HUGE boba addict)
- I really loved the campus and libraries. 
- One of my best friends committed and I would likely share a dorm with her. I also have several other close friends who committed
- Berkeley has a much better law department, so making connections there could be very beneficial
- Not that rankings define everything, but Berkeley is ranked #1 for English
- Nicer weather
- Double Major seems doable 
- Possibility of studying abroad in Japan (my dream + mother country!) 
- I felt more inspired in Berkeley 
- Everyone there seemed very similar to myself, and I felt as if I fit in more. 
- The theatre department seemed awesome and I know there is a film major. 
- Fantastic mock trial
- There are excellent opportunities for my future goals
- Much closer to home

Berkeley Cons: 
- I have heard countless rumors (and firsthand accounts from my friends that go there) that Berkeley fosters a very competitive and stressful environment. 
- Housing crisis + bad dorm situation 
- Professors seem very detached 
- in general it felt as if the school had something to prove. Berkeley spent a ton of time bragging about its rankings and very little time making students actually feel welcome. Cal Day was also a lot more unorganized (of course, considering the sheer number of people, this is completely understandable!) 
- I had a pretty rough financial aid appointment that did not help in the slightest. While I am basing my cost estimation on the UC financial aid calculator, Berkeley won’t tell me my actual aid until after May 1st (Hopkins deadline) 
- I am worried I would fall behind if I am one of countless students. I put in a lot of additional work to succeed in my classes by using my free periods to meet with my teachers, and at Berkeley, the opportunities for individualized support are significantly fewer. 
- People felt less mature and driven in comparison to Hopkins students. 
- I know several people who hated Berkeley that are pretty similar to myself 

Overall, I loved the area of Berkeley and the campus. It felt incredibly alive and I could easily see myself living there. There also seemed to be countless great opportunities in relation to my interests. Having great friends already is also a plus! However, I am worried I would be swallowed up by the immense amount of people competing for the same success. There seems to be far too many people for fewer resources, and not knowing my financial aid is worrying. ",2024-04-21 17:02:26

Doesn't really matter that much, tbh.  Usually the difference between a BS and a BA is a few more math courses, a few more CS electives, and maybe physics.

The way wait lists work is they expect you to accept an offer somewhere else and put down a deposit.  If you're accepted off the wait list then you (usually) sacrifice your deposit at the school where you originally enrolled and enroll at the wait list school instead.

You should do whatever you need to do with respect to the FAFSA so you can get a final price at Smith as soon as possible.  Then you'll know where you stand and can make an informed decision.

Even if Columbia is where you really want to go, you should accept an offer somewhere else (either Smith or this school in your home country) before the deadline.

770,t3_1c9szj4,1713734240.0,"Hi guys I'm an international student from Argentina and I'm trying to decide between these two options to study Mechanical Engineering. 

Purdue University:

Pros:

• Ranked 8th in USA (6th in mechanical) and 25th worldwide in engineering (US News and QS)

• Can do an aerospace minor (my dream was studying aerospace yet due to the citizenship requirements to work in the aero industry I'll do mechanical and then see)

• Near Indianapolis (great city, hosts indy 500, lots of recruiting companies)

• So big in engineering (~1/3 of enrolled students are in eng.)

• As a consequence of being so big in engineering it has lots of extracurricular activities and opportunities in engineering.


Cons:

• Very cold (lived in Buenos Aires all my life, with my coldest day being 0C°)

• Very long flight from Argentina (at least 1 stop) and 1 hour drive from Indianapolis to West Lafayette

• College town (always lived in a big city)

• ~45k cost (my parents can afford it though)

• Don't know the area (never visited)


University of Florida:

Pros:

• Can do double-major (Mechanical and Aerospace) with just 1 more semester

• 10k of scolarship per year (ends up being 40k) and as costs are also ~45k it ends up being ~35k

• Good climate

• I have visited Florida many times so I'm pretty familiar, and I've also visited UF's campus which is really nice

• It is a shorter trip from home (Stop in Miami, flight Orlando and 1h of driving)

• My parents seem to like UF better, as the climate for them is crucial yet for me not so much

• Ranked top 30 best universities in the USA.


Cons:

• It's engineering program is much lower than Purdue, 48th in the USA (30something in Mechanical) and 153th in the world (US News and QS)

• College town (same as Purdue)

• It's not so focused in engineering (for me its a con yet it could end up being better for me idk)


Please help me if you have any recommendations/suggestions regarding this choice and also major and career-wise!! I think I'm leaning onto Purdue but I'm still deciding what to do. Thank you!

* close to home
* easier to study abroad (instate scholarship covers it)
* Easier in general to make larger financial investments, as the money my parents have saved up (roughly 200k) could be used to buy a house or a car in the future
* free tuition (huge)
* friends go here
* Good research 
* Weather
* Number 1 for MechE, CivilE, IE and top 5 for most other engineering 
* Would feel less pressured because I am spending less money
* I like the campus (but not in the way I like Michigans)

gt cons:

* Engineering school- I'm interested in optometry, business, and law (a wide net of interests), and I've heard that the humanities at GT are subpar
* The orchestra is not good, I want to play violin in college so this is pretty important (although Emory does allow you to play in their orchestra which is quite good)
* I did not like the campus as much as Michigan
* sometimes lacking in school spirit (compared to michigan)
* I am from georgia so it wouldn't be anything new :(
* Allegedly the culture clubs are boring
* Bad dining hall and dorming 
* According to friends, the dating pool is pretty bad as the there's more males than females, and the schedules at tech are really hard to align
* Need car (i have one, so not much of a con but sometimes driving is a pain in the butt)

UMPros:

* BEAUTIFUL campus and city
* Wide range of ppl and info- You got ur music majors, business majors.. etc. Meet lots of diff types of majors rather than Engineering/CS
* I'm largely undecided, so I wouldn't be pressured into engineering as I could pick whatever major and get a very good program regardless of what I pick
* I would be able to study Violin here, as I have been accepted for the Spring semester for Violin performance
* Ross School of Business 
* Larger East Asian population than Tech
* Parties
* Dining and dorming are good 
* Big campus 
* Alumni network is world class
* Dream school
* Bus system is stellar

There is always transferring and grad school if you are into that. Only your last degree really matters, and you’re well equipped to pursue it. However, I really do believe that college is what you make of it, no matter where you go! Yes, maybe you’ll have to fight a bit harder for opportunities or attention in a larger or “less prestigious” school, but you’re equipped to do well because of your rigorous high school career!

You will certainly need to compensate for your GPA with this project and with a high SAT/ACT score.

827,t1_l0nqeip,1713737571.0,"RPI is a phenomenal school that demands a lot from their admits (high sat/act scores, GPA requirements, and classes prereqs at a minimum), and you should be proud to go there with a fabulous scholarship! 

I graduate from RPI this spring with a bachelors in engineering, and when I went onwards to do my graduate school interviews, multiple directors from multiple top universities within the United States acknowledge RPI as a ""peer institution"" and applaud RPI's programs as being rigorous and capable of producing engineers a league above average. Many of my peers end up working for Tesla or go forth to the Ivies for Graduate School, and I personally got accepted into the graduate program of my dreams. In terms of jobs, I have also networked with many machine learning directors in DARPA labs or private industry (across the United States, not just in upstate New York), and I see a lot of RPI alumni as CEOs, inventors, entrepreneurs, and influencers in the field. RPI also allowed me to indulge in start-up culture and help me with the patenting/start-up process (and even win a ton of awards from it), all for the price of free, which explains our high patent-holder rate amongst undergraduate students. I'm unsure if you know, but we recently got the world's first IBM Quantum System One computer, and students are allowed to conduct research on this stunning piece of equipment (with faculty approval of course). For computer science, that is a one-of-a-kind opportunity that you won't find anywhere else (and it helps that RPI is a R1 research institution, aka, the same research quality/level as MIT or Stanford)!!

Another reason why I like RPI is that it's a small school, and hence, it is MUCH more easy to get into your desired classes and network with faculty, and thus, get involved in undergraduate research/projects. I have friends in larger schools (Think  UTAustin or UMich) where, due to the sheer amount of students in that school, they are unable to sign up for the classes they want and even graduate on time because of it. The intimacy of the school also makes giving feedback easy. I am really close with the Deans, and I often find myself conversing with them during public events that the school holds. Obtaining letters of recommendations for scholarships, fellowships, and jobs became easy as long as you put yourself out there. The ranking on the U.S News doesn't mean anything if you cannot pursue the education that you desire, so don't feel bogged down over individuals who care more about impressing others and stroking their own ego than actually making a difference in this world and being a scholar. 

While RPI has it's flaws, college is what you make use of it. Any prestigious organization (may it be a graduate program or a top company) would rather take a student that goes to RPI and has made the most out of their college resources verses an Ivy league Student who simply has a title to their name. You and your ivy league friends are graduating with the same exact degree, so what differentiates you at the end of the day is your experiences and attitude (and differences in student debt).

828,t1_l0nqgj8,1713737592.0,"I see lots of public high schools pushing dual/concurrent enrollment programs, selling them as an amazing opportunity. I think for average students planning to attend their in-state public schools, DE can be a cost savings. However, for students aiming for selective schools, AP is typically viewed more favorably by admissions officers. AP rigor is considered more consistent with test scores to validate grades, whereas  DE rigor is a wildcard. 

Honestly, I think programs that support an associates degree by HS graduation are a marketing ploy. I saw a family member over-extend herself to get an AS in HS (and she is very bright and hardworking). As an engineering major, she'll still need nearly 4 years at her in-state flagship. If she went out of state or to a private university, earning an AS would have been a waste.

T-20s are looking for factors that are unique and, ultimately, an associates degree just isn't. However, earning an AS won't hurt an applicant unless it prevents them from doing something interesting, unique, and/or impressive that grabs an AO's attention.",2024-04-21 18:13:12

Iowa - pros

In-state tuition and scholarships bring it to 13 k a year (maybe less)

Not too long of a commute

Good school for research, good premed facilities and hospital. 

Honors program housing and classes

Music opportunities as non-major and am close with one of the music professors

Friends from HS

Cons - 

Again, close to home

Not a fan of the 'small city urban' setting

Weather

UTD - pros 

Full ride, generous housing and stipend coverage

guaranteed research funding/overseas study funding stipends

Warm weather

pedestrian campus, really enjoyed visiting it. Perfect size imo.

Growing programs, large student body and close to city.

Honors program - access to internships and other programs if I apply (made easier).

Lots of academic funding, lower sport focus

Honors students seem close with each other, good social opportunities.

music opportunities for non-major are available

Cons - 

Flying distance

Not as high in rankings

Relatively new programs, less of a focus no natural sciences from what I've heard

Competition from TX residents for premed and less onsite opportunities - no hospital etc., campus is still under growth

Neutral - 

Very diverse? (as a south asian I guess this is just something I'm not used to where I live but not really a concern)

UMN Twin Cities - Pros

Large scholarship offered

Good research school and generally good for both intended majors

Drive distance is ok for us

Higher ranked compared to UTD

Music stuff is available

Very urban

Honors housing and opportunities - more selective too

A few friends from HS

Cons - 

35k a year even with the scholarship

Weather 

Walking distance and concern for safety in city

VERY large student body, worried about social life and also extreme competition.

Im hoping to pursue an MD-PhD, and im not sure which school would be better for me. Im not exactly sure what MD-PhD admissions looks like and was hoping if any of the mods/experienced would be able to give some advice.

Berkeley:

Pros:

* tons of MD-PhD alums from looking at mstp class profiles (but is it a sample size thing?)
* more classes to take (not sure if its impt for md-phd admissions to take biophy chem, inorganic, etc.. that my current sch doesnt offer)
* UCSF nearby for research/clinical experience (but would i be able to get into the labs? :00)
* near home, love the bay/sf way more than tx
* already have friends there/will fit in socially
* unsure if id be able to access advising/find mentors
* prestiege

Cons:

- terrified for my gpa (grade deflation) (MCB major, i would just take 13 credits there per semester if possible i think to try and combat this, graduating in 2yrs)

- harder to build connections w profs/get LOR

- have to apply into clubs

- is it good for pre med? heard its hard to make it as a pre med there

- giant class sizes (would i be able to get help if im struggling? im not afraid to get help here, but i wonder if the professors would get annoyed at berk or want to help since its a research institution)

Southwestern uni:

Pros:

* already have connections w profs/good LOR
* officer position held in club, although club life here is pretty dead.
* UT lab, got in for the summer program, hoping they'll keep me for the fall
* small class sizes
* not scared for my gpa (graduating in 1.5yrs and double majoring socio +biochem)

Cons:

* socially, i hate it here.
* no prestiege
* no one has applied for MD-PhD before, though it has a good reputation within tx for sending kids to medical school 
* location. kind of nothing to do here, and austin is kinda boring too

I required that I must study one unit each day before acquiring a delicious medium iced coffee. Now, if I test myself and do incredibly well on that specific unit, I can grab myself a banana bread.

So where does my mom come in? Well she has control over my card. Whenever I provide proof of studying (and I don't lie so I don't need to worry about that lol), I can grab an iced coffee that my mom can buy for me through the Dunkin app. Sounds complicated, but isn't.

I have a 1500 sat, 11 ap, and I’d say my ECs are way above the average, running multiple clubs, being a top national hs debater, earning money from my own 3d modeling projects, and having an engineering internship.

A side note on my bad grades, I was diagnosed with ADHD and depression back in just my sophomore year without being able to do much about it since middle school (my parents didn’t believe in issues with mental health).

Before I start. I'd like to congratulate everyone on getting in and even waitlisted in for all the transfer students!! I hope the ones that commit have an amazing experience there and a wonderful time whatever they decide to do!

I applied for Data Science in UCB, UCD, UCSD, and UCLA. I have a GPA of 3.86 and I think my PIQs are good and I have many ECs in leadership(student leader), work experience in campus for multiple positions(tutoring and student ambassador), work experience in HS(Intern in a tax consultation company - working with excel/SQL, intern in a restaurant and helping with finance), Honors, Phi Theta Kappa, officer in multiple clubs part of my major, and developed an app for gym user to input their progress as a diary. Had a startup on gym supplements with 2 other partners. I am a OOS from a comcol and a international student.

I got rejected by UCB, UCD and waitlisted in UCSD

The only thing that is bugging me now is that my A Levels were very bad and my first quarter(Spring 2022 that I took while in High School) I had 2 Fs in English Composition and PreCalc. I explained that during that time I had lost all motivation but the value of education grew back for me when I saw the efforts of my parents to make sure I get a good education). I retook those classes and got A and B- as in my community College we have a thing called Course Repeat Request in which I can retake my classes and I keep the latest grade I get in my course.

My main question is this, was the reason of my Waitlist/Rejection possibly cause that UCs and California don't have the Course Repeat Request(as I'm not sure if this rule is a thing there) or just not a good application from my side.",2024-04-21 20:18:06

I just have second thoughts and FOMO about joining two years later than everyone.

920,t3_1c9x4nw,1713745305.0,"Hey all!

I'm a CS student trying to decide between attending Stony Brook and Cornell. This decision may seem obvious, but the catch is my financial situation.

Here's the deal: I come from a wealthy family, and my parents have made it clear that they are going to give me a flat $100,000 to pay for my undergrad (not sure if I'm gonna go for a grad degree), which I am grateful for. To be clear, we make enough money so that I don't qualify for any financial aid.

This means that it would cost me a total of $340,000 (85k x 4) to attend Cornell, so I would have to take out $240,000 in student loans, while I would be able to attend SBU with extra money in my pocket. I would also be able to graduate from Stony Brook 1 year early.

I do not particularly prefer one school's campus/student-experience to the other's, so this is not a big factor in my decision.

Is the difference between Cornell and Stony Brook in CS worth $240k in loans and a year of my life? What would you do in my situation? All opinions are appreciated.

Every single school - including NYU and USC - is a fullride, so money is not a factor at all (my family is super low income lol)

All the schools I got into: NYU Stern, USC Marshall, Cornell Dyson, UC Berkeley Haas, Brown, UT Austin McCombs, JHU, Notre Dame, Tufts, Dartmouth Econ, Vanderbilt Econ, Georgetown McDonough for Finance, Northwestern Econ, UMich Ross, WashU Olin, UNC (no KF), UVA (not Mcintire yet)

I'm currently leaning towards NYU Stern as I love its environment and it seems best fit for me, and I absolutely loved touring the area. Manhattan is an amazing place and I know that I can get some great internship opportunities at Stern. It's both a top tier program while being super prestigious as well. The opportunities are just hard to give up, like their insane library and I can even access a lot of programs and the library at Columbia down the street. A lot of my friends that currently attend Wharton say that the Stern kids they've worked with are literally more intelligent and even get better internships over them being on Wall Street which is pretty insane to me, and it's a lot chiller and less competitive and they have a Stern curve which makes it impossible to have a trash GPA if you somewhat try so NYU places on par with ivies. Plus barron trump is going there 😋

There's also insane business schools like UMich Ross and CMU Tepper. CMU would give me a chance to also major in Computer Science, which they are top of the top for CS. I think it would be pretty useful having that CS knowledge at some point, but they just don't have the recruiting Stern gives. Same with UMich; it's really well rounded and good in most things but Stern's recruiting just seems better (even if it's slightly). Also I don't think I would do well at UMich, given their difficulty and the whole party scene which I'm not much of a fan of.

For the west coast schools like USC Marshall and UC Berkeley Haas, I'm not sure if I want to work in the West Coast; I much rather prefer the Wall Street area. Are these schools that I should seriously be considering over Stern? Same with UT Austin McCombs.

UVA (out of state) is also pretty good with recruiting but I don't like the public school environment of parties and greek life. I also don't like how the McIntire Commerce School requires me to apply at the end of my freshman year (also I heard they take a lot of diversity admits, and I'm white lol)

Then there are all the super prestigious universities I got into (which I'm very thankful for): Notre Dame, JHU, Tufts, Dartmouth, Vanderbilt, Georgetown business, Northwestern, WashU, Cornell. All these schools are really good in the field, and some of them I got into their business schools like Notre Dame, Georgetown, Cornell and WashU. And for the ivies/T15s I got into for economics, I know they are really good as well. Would I be missing out if I ended up choosing NYU Stern? How can I compare the opportunities I would gain from these schools to the opportunities I would have at Stern?

  
Honestly from all the people I've talked to in person, all my friends, advisors, family, and even alumni I connected with on LinkedIn that go to each of these schools - they all recommend me going to NYU Stern for the next four years. I love NYU as a whole; it's an amazing school with the second best business school in the world and I could see why it tops all of these other amazing schools I got into. I just don't want to regret my choice in the future. If you guys were in my situation what would be your preference?",2024-04-21 20:43:45

You can be a big fish in a different pond by not going to a top-tier school. His big analysis shows that this can be the best way to go. Also you can try to transfer if you really want to do that and if you go to grad school of course that's a whole different level and it can end up being a lot more important than undergrad.

1. You save money. A lot of money. 

2. A lot of public universities are still good.

3. A lot of public universities have an elite tier you can enroll into, like an honors program.

4. You are now the big fish in a smaller pool, making it easier for you to outcompete the competition and get good grades.

5. Elite grad school offers are still quite attainable with a good record at a public university. And they waive your tuition.

It’s understandable to feel upset, as you are grieving; it’s important to embrace emotions during this time, and allow yourself to feel them. Because of the hard work you’ve put in, you will be well-equipped for whatever college you choose. Being proactive and a hard worker will help you in whatever you do, and there is always grad school or transfers. Again, I completely understand where you’re coming from. I would be devastated. Please remember to take care of yourself, and remind yourself that academics say nothing about you as a person, and you are worth so much more than that",2024-04-21 20:59:47

968,t3_1c9xzd3,1713747848.0,"Hey, I've been needing some assistance regarding where I should head to college for my freshman year, and I was hoping someone within this subreddit might be able to see what the better decision is for me. All of this has already been talked about with my school counselor, with her always ending up saying pick which one makes you happier, but that doesn't really help me in my current situation.

I had been deferred and then rejected by my dream college (Columbia University) and am currently wait-listed from NYU (which I have a legacy to). I have applied to a plethora of colleges, receiving mostly rejections and waitlists with very few acceptances due to most of them being prestige colleges. However, I have been admitted to Adelphi University (with honors), which was my backup to Columbia, but my parents do not want me to go to Adelphi since it does not hold ""presegious"" status according to them. The only real reason I wanted to go to Adelphi was to have a backup plan for entering Columbia Engineering, but now looking at the campus and the location of the university, I do not like a single thing about Adelphi. But just yesterday I got off the waitlist from Stevens Institute of Technology, which my parents would like me to go to. I do like the campus and the student life there better than Adelphi, but I definitely want to head into the Columbia Engineering program since I have been stuudying and working to go there since elementary school.

Please help me. I have felt like everything I have done from elementary school until high school is going into the garbage if I go to Adelphi, but I won't feel like that if I go to Stevens, with the only problem being that I won't get into my dream school, for which I have worked hard for many years. Any advice is welcomed. Thank you very much!

Edit: I forgot to add that I care about my athletics as much as I care about my academics, but I would much rather play D3 softball than play D2. If heading to Columbia I would cease playng softball.

Summary: I want to go to Stevens for my undergrad, but I also want to go to Adelphi only for their joint degree program with Columbia University.

1011,t3_1c9ypwc,1713750146.0,"Hey! (This will be a long post; sorry!) My younger brother (college c/o ‘28) is having difficulties choosing between Stanford, Williams, and UPenn, and I’m posting about the situation here for advice. For some context, he’s planning to major in a combination of CS, business, and math. He was admitted to UPenn’s School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) after being rejected from the M&amp;T program. The cost of attending any of these three institutions would be approximately the same for him and isn’t a factor in his decision.

Williams is one of his top choices because he loves its rural, spread-out campus, its very small grade and class sizes, and its high-quality liberal arts teaching methods. Stanford is a runner-up because although it has one of the world’s best CS programs and is located in Silicon Valley, my brother dislikes the congested campus and surrounding suburbs, the relatively large grade and class sizes, and the somewhat toxic “tech bro” and Y Combinator culture. Penn is another runner-up because he’s not a huge fan of the urban location (but not necessarily a hater either), but he is also extremely interested in UPenn’s business-related programs and clubs and its entrepreneurship culture (which he believes is better in certain ways than Stanford’s).

I’m currently majoring in CS at MIT. My dislike for many aspects of my university and my regret that I didn’t commit elsewhere catalyzed my academic and mental health struggles in college. As a result, I’m extremely invested in helping my brother find his “best fit” college. However, I’m worried that since Williams isn’t a well-known “target school” for CS and has a tiny CS department, he’d be missing out on insane coursework, research, and internship opportunities that could be found somewhere like Stanford or UPenn. My brother is not focused on obtaining a huge starting salary or going into big tech, but I want him to be financially comfortable after college (especially because he will likely be taking out a loan of some size to complete his undergrad). Furthermore, the main reason why he’s considering UPenn is that he’s hoping to get involved in its business opportunities or even switch to Wharton. However, I’m worried he’s banking on switching from SEAS to Wharton because I’ve heard that’s difficult. However, I also feel bad about pushing him to go to Stanford when he dislikes it a bit, as my parents similarly pushed me into committing to MIT. I’m posting here in hopes of obtaining other opinions on this matter and am especially interested in hearing from students/alumni at these universities and from parents.

tl;dr: my brother is choosing between Stanford, Williams, and UPenn SEAS. He’s planning to major in some combination of CS, business, and math, and the factors that are most important to him are location (rural or urban &gt; suburban), small class size, and quality of teaching.

I applied to many colleges and was fortunate enough to get into these two. These two are currently the final on my list, and I absolutely love them both. However, I'm having a hard time choosing between them, so I was hoping you guys could give me some insights.

Major: Computer Science

**Career goal:** My main focus is to get into Cybersecurity. I got into both Purdue and RIT as a Cybersecurity major but unfortunately cannot attend due to low aid. I'm not entirely sure of this part and might change, but I want to do a Master's in Cybersecurity (preferably from MIT/CMU/Georgia Tech/UC Berkeley). After getting a job and gaining experience in the field, I want to open my own Cybersecurity Company/Startup/Business.



Lehigh Pros:

1 Awesome emphasis on STEM

2. I got into their Computer Science and Business honors program, and this program kinda aligns with my career goals, as I wanna open my own business afterward. Apparently, it's very hard to get in; they take only 40 students per year (hard limit)

3. Easier to get internships.

4. Better career fair, more tech companies show up.

5. Better average starting salary (6 digits) and ROI of the honors program that I got in.

6. 100% job placement rate in the honors program that I got in. everyone gets a job within 6 months of graduation.

7. Parents leaning towards Lehigh more due to the high starting salary and job prospects (not a big deal, tbh)

8. More people of my ethnicity (it kind of matters to me)



Lehigh Cons:

1. Even though the campus is extremely pretty, it feels too hilly for me.
2. Costs a little bit more than Vassar, but like around 3.5k/year
3. Being the bigger school, probably less interaction/communication with professors compared to Vassar.
4. Food and dorm are pretty good but not better than Vassar.
5. Less prestige, lower ranked than Vassar 😛(?)



Vassar Pros:

1. Extremely Beautiful Campus, no complaints.
2. Fewer students, more accessible to get ahold of professors
3. Would be easier to get to top grad schools (Correct me if I'm wrong)
4. Better Food and dorm.
5. Joint 3+2 Program with Dartmouth. I'm really interested in this, and if I commit to Vassar, I will definitely apply here.
6. Full ride
7. Better Alum Network than Lehigh (Correct me if I'm wrong)
8. More prestigious and better ranked (Correct me if I'm wrong about the prestige part)



Vassar Cons:

1. Liberal Arts Education. I'm pretty sure what I wanna do, so I really don't need a broader generalized education, and kinda prefer specialized education at this point.
2. Way less emphasis on CS. Like literally nobody talked or bought up CS on the admitted students day.
3. Less internship opportunities, no tech companies show up in career fair, definitely would be harder to get a job after graduating.
4. Immigrant parents against studying in Vassar. They think ""University"" is superior to ""College"" (not a big deal if I really want to go to Vassar, I can convince them)

Basically, the whole thing boils down to this:

I'm not sure how studying CS at Vassar would be. I Know Lehigh will be better career-wise/in the long run, but I'd probably be happier in Vassar for the next four years. I know Lehigh CS is good, but is Vassar's CS better or worse than Lehigh's?",2024-04-21 22:05:45

What I suspect—although can't prove—is that some of the ""insane"" applicants you see online who get rejected everywhere have an unflattering superiority complex that shows in their essays

Also, some people just straight up lie on the Internet for whatever reason. Like I actually found one of my friends' chanceme posts once, and strangely, he decided to list a couple of APs on his profile that he wasn't actually taking, and he rounded his SAT score up by 100 points (idk what the point of lying about stats online is, but people do it)",2024-04-21 22:06:43

Hey, would love some advice on where to go. Super conflicted. Applied CS, planning to minor in biology or econ, though I don't think that matters. For context, I am **not** following US News rankings since they are known to be biased. I am also out of state for both schools.

Here's my list of pros and cons, ranked from what matters the **most** to what matters the **least** (prestige and job opportunities are most important for me, followed by cost. To be honest, location is nearly the same for both, or else that would usually be of importance to me). Please correct me if anything is inaccurate on this list!

*UMich*

* Ranked top 5 or top 10 by most for CS
* Cheaper for me
* Company recruits are good (Amazon, automotive companies b/c proximity to Detroit)
* Lots of different opportunities to pursue other interests (with minors, clubs, other T20 programs etc.)
* Overall more fun, diverse (sports, art, dance, music, Ann Arbor is nice)
* Somewhat farther away from me than Cornell

*Cornell*

* Ranked top 15 or top 20 by most for CS
* Ivy -League connections
* Way more expensive for me, reaching nearly 100k in tuition
* Middle of nowhere, harder to get recruited/find jobs
* Less overall opportunities in terms of clubs, alternative programs, etc.
* School culture seems horrific (i.e. competitive nature, depressing place)
* Ithaca is literally middle of nowhere
* Sort of closer to me?

It may seem like I have a negative view on Cornell overall, but honestly I'm still struggling to pick because of possible Ivy connections. Would love some insight from anyone though - parents, students from both schools, staff, whoever! Thanks in advance.",2024-04-21 22:07:19

T20 schools are generally private and often do not give any college credit for for DE community college classes. By contrast, many excellent state public universities work closely with their state’s community college system to grant extensive college credit for dual enrollment courses. Students can knock general education requirements out of the way during high school and even get a head start on prerequisite classes for their major. California is known for having a robust system awarding credit for community college classes. In my state, Washington, UW has a “running start” dual enrollment program that allows students to enter UW as sophomore status (or even further along ). Many kids graduate early and save money as a result. Does your state have public universities your kids might want to attend? 

Colleges will recognize the rigor of doing dual enrollment, especially if it allows your kids to take more challenging classes than are available in their high school. But they should consider why they are taking DE. For acceleration? For classes that interest them that are not available at their high school? To get away from a less desirable social environment? To save money in college by being able to get credits during high school and graduate early (or double major, pursue more opportunities in college, etc). 

If your kids are considering doing DE, they may want to at least apply to some of their state universities to leave open the opportunity of maximizing DE credits. At one of my kids’ schools (a top LAC), DE would give you nothing - no college credit, but might mean you could take a higher level class. Many top private schools also give very limited credit for AP classes as well. Some only allow 1 or two classes of college credit for AP classes. Public universities tend to give much more credit for both DE and AP classes. 

Also, kids taking DE credits in high school should treat all of their DE classes as serious college courses that will have grades on a transcript that may follow them into graduate school. Medical schools, for example, include DE grades in their calculation of undergraduate GPA. This catches applicants off guard every year since they took the courses in high school. 

For specific schools of interest, you should look up their policies on taking credit for AP or dual enrollment. (Note: transfer students from community college are treated differently with how their credits are handled from DE high school students applying directly to college).",2024-04-21 22:28:31

I’m worried that if I go to UT, my experience there will be clouded by concerns about my financial future, but I’m also worried that if I go to Syracuse, I’ll spend every day there wondering “what if I went to UT.” Which school should I pick?

Hi, kind people!

After receiving all of my college decisions, I’ve narrowed my picks down to UT Austin and Syracuse University, both for the 5-year B.Arch program. At UT, I was also accepted into the Plan II Honors program and, after attending the admitted student’s day, I fell in love with UT. The professors were indescribably amazing, the atmosphere warm and welcoming, and the people energizing and passionate. I left the tour feeling pulled by a gut instinct to commit to UT (which I’m inclined to follow because I believe those impulses are guides to the right path). 

The problem is UT won’t release financial aid offers until mid-May… after I’d have to make my decision.

Onto the flip side of this debacle, Syracuse offered me just over 50% off for all 5 years, making the total price just under half of that for UT. Being that I’m footing the bill for student loans by myself, this is no small offer. I was also invited to apply to the Renee Crown Honors program, which I did and will hear back from this week. 

Now that sounds like a dream too, but the problem lay in the fact that I didn’t really like Syracuse that much, and I didn’t even come close to feeling the same level of instinct to go there, even after knowing how much money they’re giving me. I also don’t want to end up in NYC, as most architects from Syracuse do (due to job availability). And, I hate the weather there. It’s a small thing, for sure, but I’m worried about seasonal depression.

Does anyone have advices for which school I should pick? I’m panicking because I’m running out of time. I feel REALLY pulled to UT but is that really God speaking through me or is just wishful thinking? I’m afraid to put myself in debt, but I also don’t want to be stuck at a school I hate just because of money. 

What should I do?

P.S. If you read all of this and/or are giving me advice, bless you! I really need the help :)

I was literally in your exact place when I finished high school. Rejected from every top school I applied to, even though I felt I had done literally all that could've been expected of me. I was extremely depressed and embarrassed about talk about my future. I resented all the time I put into my apps and high school studies.


I was wrong. Getting rejected from the ivies opened doors I never would have been granted access to at Harvard or MIT. I coasted through my undergrad degree at a decent, but not top ranked, university. Ended up as valedictorian and built strong personal relationships with brilliant professors simply by virtue of being an extremely engaged, academically trained, and organized student in a community where that was not guaranteed. The result was I landed some crazy cool internships, published original research early in my undergrad, and got invited by my university leadership to meet all kinds of important donors/alumni/etc. so they could show off a star student.


Ultimately, those experiences plus oodles of luck landed me a Rhodes Scholarship. I am certain (having met the Rhodes Scholars from Harvard in my year) that the fellowship office at Harvard would not have given me a second glance. But my ""lesser"" university was perfectly happy to nominate me and all those professors and internship bosses I met wrote glowing recommendations on my behalf.


Now one of the most treasured experiences of my life is the years I got to spend on the Rhodes at Oxford. So many things I never thought I could achieve have become accessible to me because I ended up in an undergrad environment where I could stand out and excel relative to my peers, while still being surrounded by plenty of smart and wonderful people (there are brilliant people worth meeting at almost every university).

Lol what? It's comparable bro. No. Don't fall for the marketing. I knew 2 friends who chose Columbia over MIT during my time. And a friend who didn't go CalTech at undergrad for Physics but then headed to CalTech for grad school afterwards. That said, I would also be lying if I claimed MIT is not a better technical school overall.

I know when I applied to college, Columbia SEAS had higher average SAT scores than MIT. Right now, Columbia overall (CC + SEAS) is 1510\~1560 and MIT is 1520\~1570. The caliber of most students at undergrad are the same at either. In fact, most students in T20 privates at undergrad are similar. I do however expect outliers in technical fields to be stronger at MIT (but those students are generally taking grad school courses). Those interested in MIT at large want to focus more on technical while those interested in Columbia SEAS at large want to also focus outside technical at undergrad.

&gt;Students AT COLUMBIA told me to go to MIT because Columbia doesn't have an answer for a lot of the stuff that MIT has

Makes sense considering MIT is number 1 for material engineering. And both Columbia and MIT are about the same for political science.

Ok.. again. Students at both schools are similar at undergrad. Seriously... (le sigh). This isn't some movie. This is real life.

Go head to NYU Stern. I doubt you will enjoy IB like most others after actually trying out due to the insanely poor wlb but that's for another matter.

&gt;end up creating my own business/startup after doing IB for some time.

You don't randomly create these companies. You need a proven track record in the real world. That's on you. Not on school.

For IB, NYU Stern is great due to proximity to Wall Street. Dartmouth also does well but Stern is the most direct. Since you have full ride at Stern, no reason not to.

&gt;A lot of my friends that currently attend Wharton say that the Stern kids they've worked with are literally more intelligent and even get better internships over them being on Wall Street which is pretty insane to me

Your friends are very nice and modest. Good on them. Your friends definitely want to help you by guiding you to Stern for the things you want to do. Listen to your friends.

&gt;CMU would give me a chance to also major in Computer Science, which they are top of the top for CS. I think it would be pretty useful having that CS knowledge at some point, but they just don't have the recruiting Stern gives.

Your interests you are talking about do not align with CS. Do you want to build stuff like robots? No? Then I don't see how CS matters. It's like a businessman contemplating how studying pre-med might not be helpful directly in the career; it's just different fields.

&gt;For the west coast schools like USC Marshall and UC Berkeley Haas, I'm not sure if I want to work in the West Coast; I much rather prefer the Wall Street area. Are these schools that I should seriously be considering over Stern? Same with UT Austin McCombs.

* you should start identifying refence letter writers this spring.  Ask them in person and follow up with an email with possible timeline.  Some may ask for a brag sheet.
* Please run your net price calculators with your parents. Paying for college isn't magic.  Not every option is open to every student and family.  This process is painted as this merit based wonderland.  Nope - quite a bit about MONEY.  Most highly rejective schools enroll a majority of full or close to full pay students.
* Shopping for schools can look quite different if you are looking for generous financial aid vs. looking for merit/have a firm budget in mind vs. have unlimited funds.
* Let someone read and help edit your essays and your entire application.  Preferably a trusted adult/parent if that works for you.
* Consider setting up an email JUST for college applications.  Sharing it with a parent might be helpful watching for important emails because you will get 98% very unimportant spam emails.  When you accept a school, you can then change to your preferred email.
* Consider keeping your college list and results on the down low until you make a decision if you don't want a bunch of uneducated and unsolicited opinions.
* A safety school ideally is a school that accepts &gt; 70% where your stats are above the 75% that is also affordable.  Please get VERY comfortable with and excited about your safety schools, and actually research these choices.  Just because a school is less popular doesn't mean the education is less valuable.
* Those popular public flagship universities that everyone is applying to from out of state?  They are most likely NOT your safety.  I'm not just talking about UCLA and Michigan and Chapel Hill.  I'm also talking about Purdue, Ohio, UW Madison, Georgia, Stony Brook, etc and who knows what will become more trendy to apply to next year.  Especially if you're interested in CS, engineering, business, etc.  That doesn't mean don't apply.  That means understand that OOS students aren't their priority when many apply and it's very hard to predict.
* Other state's flagships will often expect you to be full pay or close.  Research this ahead of time.  You can dig around in common data sets and get a sense of merit.
* Prioritize your application list, starting with a rolling and/or EA safety(or multiple).  Alternate safer/reachier options, consider financial viability.  Then if you don't get to every school toward the end of your list, it's not the end of the world.
* Consider that school popularity has a lot to do with location and marketing.
* YOU as a student can take out up to 27K over ALL 4 years.  That is it.  Anything else is going to require your parents finances on the line.
* If you want more insight into the process, read/listen to ""***Who Gets In and Why***"" by Jeffrey Selingo.  The quick summary is this - the process isn't actually personal  and there are lots of great choices out there.  Good read for parents who may seem overly invested where you may get accepted.  You can't control admissions offices.

I am planning no matter what to get a STEM degree and go to higher education after (masters, p.a. school, med school, phd) 

UW-

Pros: campus is perfect, in Seattle (food+tech hub+lots to do), full college experience, lots of unique clubs, great greek system, ranked 25th for engineering, felt like students were very friendly and welcoming, lots of study abroad options

Cons: extremely capacity constrained major (will be stressed out first 2 years cuz i’m engineering undeclared direct to college), highest acceptance rate (prestige kinda bothers me+may mean it’s less desirable to companies/ less quality academically idk), weather, heard area is really unsafe

UC Davis-

Pros: In-state tuition, know a lot of kids that loved it (connections+reassuring), very stem focused, ranked 28th overall, ~35% acceptance rate, nice weather, close-ish to sf, sacramento, and silicon valley, yummy food in area, bme major seemed to have cool new classes, actually in my major, safe, cool study abroad options 

Cons: Kinda in the middle of no where unless you take a 30+ min train ride, greek life looked eh, don’t know how hard it would be to get involved in research or internships in the area cuz Berkeley is right there, felt like no one looked like me (isolating?), eh sports

Northeastern:

Pros: Super low acceptance rate (would def feel good about myself), boston (activities, huge for biotech, lots to colleges in area), co-ops (not sure how clutch these are), medium size (maybe better advising + connections to professors), great ranking for engineering, probably good companies hiring

Cons: as a california kid i don’t know a lot  about it, heard all they care about is $, admitted through NUin (abroad as a freshman, limits ability to go abroad later on in school), campus doesn’t feel 100% like a campus, not super well ranked overall (makes me nervous about quality of education+opportunities), hella expensive (parents would pay but may limit further educational opportunities), idk if i would fit in on the east coast, COLD",2024-04-22 00:06:34

Intended major: Electrical and information Engineering (Imperial), Mechanical Engineering (UVA)

**UVA**

UVA Pros:

* In the US (I plan to work in the US in the future)
* More well-known in the US?
* Able to make wider social connections
* Opportunity to go to Darden (Top 10 in US?)
* More student life
* More manageable curriculum, easier to get a good GPA
* More recognized in the US when applying for grad school in the US?

UVA Cons:

* Globally lower-ranked than Imperial
* Weaker academics
* More expensive school fees (though less expensive cost of living)
* Located in an area further from the city, less opportunities?

**Imperial**

Imperial Pros:

* Stronger academics, stronger technical foundation
* More recognized globally for engineering
* City area: more convenient for London internships and daily living overall

Imperial Cons:

* Less social connections
* Harder curriculum, harder to get a good GPA
* Less recognized than a US undergrad when applying for grad school in the US?
* Holidays do not match up with US, harder to apply for US internships

&amp;#x200B;

Some other questions I have:

\- Is it true that employers in US favor UVA over ICL? 

\- Do US employers recognize UK internships? Or would they prefer US internships?",2024-04-22 00:21:01

1199,t1_l0p5pri,1713760293.0,"&gt;Why do we have to be sooo stacked to get into a T20 these days?

Ez answer, population keeps on growing = fiercer competition

With very bad job market, top companies/companies that pays good have lesser job openings, less need to recruit at worse schools because they have more than enough people who want to work for them at top schools. Besides, top schools are hard to get into in the first place so initial filtering has been done. Most intern hires are done by on campus recruiting and networks. 

we don't get the luxury to have nice childhoods like our parents/previous generation did, and so won't our grandkids if population reaches to new highs in the future.

and to everyone who claims to study economics, saying as the economy grows with population, the pie doesn't get smaller prove it to me, why it is hard to get jobs now and why chatgpt reduces tons of jobs instead of creating new jobs.

TL:DR, Its all about competition and jobs, unless you want to start your own business. If thats the case, you don't even need to go to uni unless you're starting a medical/law practice/becoming a pilot, etc.",2024-04-22 00:31:33

1205,t1_l0p6zfz,1713761005.0,"**Question:** Based on Princeton’s and Cornell’s Common Data Sets for the past few years, how likely is it that someone waitlisted at these two universities will be offered admission this year?

**ChatGPT:**

To assess the likelihood that someone waitlisted at Princeton and Cornell will be offered admission this year, we can look at the trends from the past few years as reported in their Common Data Sets (CDS). Here's a general overview of how these universities have managed their waitlists in recent years, based on available data:  
  
**Princeton University**  
• 2020-2021: Princeton University did not admit any students from the waitlist.  
• 2019-2020: No data is readily available, but given the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, admissions processes were atypical.  
• 2018-2019: Only a very small number of students, if any, were admitted from the waitlist.  
  
Princeton typically has a very low admission rate from the waitlist. In more regular admission cycles, few students are admitted from the waitlist, reflecting the university's ability to predict its yield (the percentage of students who accept offers of admission) quite accurately.  
  
**Cornell University**  
• 2020-2021: Cornell admitted a significant number from the waitlist (around 1,680 out of 6,615 waitlisted).  
• 2019-2020: This year also saw higher than usual admissions from the waitlist, partially due to uncertainties and changes in student decisions because of the pandemic.  
• 2018-2019: In a typical year, Cornell might admit between 60 to 100 students from the waitlist, depending on the yield.  
  
Cornell tends to use its waitlist more actively than Princeton, reflecting a different strategy in managing enrollment numbers and yield. The actual usage of the waitlist can vary significantly year to year, largely influenced by the number of admitted students who choose to enroll.  
  
**Predictions for This Year**  
• **Princeton**: It's likely that the number of students admitted from the waitlist will remain low, consistent with past trends. If you are waitlisted at Princeton, the chances of being admitted are not high based on historical data.  
• **Cornell**: The likelihood of being admitted from the waitlist may be higher at Cornell than at Princeton. However, this can fluctuate greatly based on how accurately the admissions office has predicted the yield and other enrollment goals for the year.  
  
For the most accurate and specific data, you should refer directly to the most recent Common Data Sets for each university or contact their admissions offices for the latest figures. The variability, especially under the influence of ongoing global circumstances like the pandemic, makes precise predictions challenging.",2024-04-22 00:43:25

The biggest obstacle to navigate when trying to get a job in the US for internationals is getting a VISA of some kind. This drastically limits the amount of employers that can and are willing to accept you for internships and full time jobs. Please do your research into this.

Imperial is a globally recognized university so do not worry about “recognition” when applying to grad school. Also, I would find it weird if US employers disregarded UK internships.

UVA is an academically rigorous institution. Not sure what about it makes it easier to get a good GPA. Another thing, Darden is UVA’s graduate business school.

UC Riverside:

Okay this one kinda seems like an oddball compared to my other options but I have my reasons

Pros
- Cal resident + my parents offered to pay my tuition if I go here so no debt!! 🥳 - California road trips! (I get a car to drive up to see my family in the Bay Area)
- Literally known for being one of the most diverse campuses (I’m Filipino so it’s rlly important for me to at least find some people of the same background as me to vibe with in college) — plus I visited the campus and they have these little rooms for each affinity group over there
- In SoCal! So that means it’s sunny :D ☀️
- One of my lowest priorities but I’d be closer to my gf and a bunch of our other friends who are also going to school in SoCal (one of them just committed to UCR)
- If I feel like transferring to another UC (lowkey might), I’d have a much better shot at that versus if I went to my other options (ik community is better for this but I’ve also heard it’s harder to get ur classes done at community in 2 years plus I want the full undergrad experience)
- New business school remodeling!! (I’m a Pre-Business major)
-Overall might just have a better sense of community (mostly just bc demographics of the school)

Cons
- Might wanna transfer outta UCR anyways because I heard that not many employers come down there 
- UCs just aren’t that good for me career/undergrad degree wise because I wanna go into Finance and they don’t have my specific concentration (plus they’re just overall limited undergrad business degree wise) 
-In comparison to CC, transferring is more difficult 
-In comparison to my other options, UCR isn’t as name brand (semi-important but not rlly to me)

Fordham:

Pros

- Really good for business AND if I wanna music minor! (New York City 🤭‼️)
    - Financial capital and broadway 🤭💫
- Half tuition + parental support 🤑‼️ (only paying $20k a year I think) 
    - Ab $800-1k would be my monthly payment 
- Jesuit institution so they have major emphasis on Social justice ! (Something I’m rlly passionate ab)
- Great for law if I ever wanna get into that 
    - The 3+3 law degree program lookin pretty good ngl 
- Stronger Asian community!
- The New York City aesthetic 😩 🏙
- They have my specific concentration 
- Also the business school is absolutely BEAUTIFUL (they have the ticking stock market thing :00) 

Cons

* Mostly just opportunity costs from other schools (esp neu which would be great experience and career wise) 
* TONS of classes and gen ed requirements not even going towards my major (more of a mid thing than con tbh)
    * Probably would have the most classes if I ever go here 
    * Like language, science, theology 😭😭 
* Ik I said the Jesuit thing was a plus but I lowkey don’t know how I feel ab going to another religious institution for my education (had that in middle school and high school alr)
* Limited study abroad opportunities if I do the 3+3 program 

—

Northeastern

Pros:
* Lowkey built a community over here with neu peeps on insta already 
* I get to travel in college!! (But not for a whole once I’m out 😀)
    * Oakland first sem; London second sem
        * I’m from the Bay Area so I don’t consider Oakland as a con bc it’s a nice transition into college 
    * Plus the dialogues, semester in, and other study abroad’s 
    * That one fashion dialogue 🤭‼️
* So easy to switch/add on majors 
    * I’d major in Fintech/Finance with a minor in fashion 
* They have a fashion minor here!! (Another thing I’m interested in)
* Co-op!! (This is obvious)
* Filipino club! (Also called barkada)
    * They have another Filipino org that’s connected to a bunch of other Boston colleges 
* I’m not on just one campus! (Great for seeing the world and broadening my horizons :D)
* Bought a ton of NEU merch alr 

Cons: 
* $50k a year is absolutely foul 😭😭
* $1.7k-2k a month 😀😀
* Tons of white people 😭 (which isn’t bad but it’ll be much harder finding my people)
    * Me and my gf had to search for hours finding a single Filipino or at least Asian person on the NEU class of 2028 page 💀
* Snow!! 😃 (more of a like mid reality check thing than a con tho)
* I’m not on just one campus (Tons of moving around and not a strong sense of community 😭)
* Might have to take summer classes?? Depends on how my credits transfer

Santa Clara University:

Currently on the waitlist for this school but semi-considering just in case I get off it 

Pros:
- My kuya/older cousin goes here already so he can hook me up to a bunch of clubs and give me advice and stuff (plus he’s alr very active in 
- Barkada club!! Rlly active and rlly strong sense of Filipino community!! (Just saw their Filipino showcase last night and I LOVED it)
- (Joke pro) Kuya said the girls are rlly hot there 😀
- Good for business and finance 
- California road trips !! 
- Sun !! 
- Can stop by my other cousin’s house to bother him and won’t have to pay for dinner sometimes :p
- Again close to home but far enough to establish my own independence 
- I get my own car!!
- Silicon Valley!!

1237,t3_1ca2nk9,1713763108.0,"Hi all! This is my second ever Reddit post! I am still adjusting and understanding how posting on here works so sorry if this isn’t very understandable and long. 

I’m at a crossroads and could really use some insight from those who have been there or are going through a similar decision-making process. I’ve been fortunate enough to receive acceptance letters from two incredible institutions, the University of Maryland (UMD) and Spelman College, and I’m struggling to choose between them because, honestly, I love both almost equally for different reasons. I have already crossed out the other schools I got into like UPenn, UMich, UVA, BU, and Howard. 

Let’s start with UMD. First off, I’ve been accepted as a Banneker/Key Scholar with a full ride, and I’m also in the honors program—talk about a dream come true! Plus, their music school and behavioral sciences program have me absolutely thrilled. I’m also drawn to the sports scene and the possibility of joining the club track team. The proximity to DC opens up a world of opportunities, and being close to Howard University means I can still immerse myself in that rich cultural experience.

However, there are some drawbacks to consider. Staying close to home might limit my personal growth, and as a PWI, I worry about missing out on the unique and uplifting experience that an HBCU like Spelman could offer. As an African American girl, I also wonder about the challenges and opportunities I might face in a predominantly white environment.

Now onto Spelman. The culture there is magnetic, and attending Spelbound this past weekend truly solidified my desire to experience the HBCU vibe for my undergrad years. Being in the heart of the “black mecca” of Atlanta means endless opportunities, and Spelman’s emphasis on community service and their pre-health program align perfectly with my goals. Plus, the idea of being in an all-girls environment is both exciting and nerve-wracking—it’s a completely different dynamic from what I’ve experienced at PWIs.

But there are some concerns. Spelman is further from home, which could be both a positive and a negative. The competition might be fierce, especially given the high expectations, and the limited sports options compared to UMD is something to consider. Also, being new to Georgia, I worry about the adjustment and making new connections.

On top of all this, there’s the financial aspect. While I have a scholarship covering a good chunk of tuition at Spelman, my family will still have to cover some costs, unlike the full ride at UMD.

I guess what it comes down to is this: Do I prioritize the financial security and familiar environment of UMD, or do I take a leap of faith and embrace the unique opportunities and culture of Spelman?",2024-04-22 01:18:28

1247,t1_l0pbnne,1713763808.0,"Hi OP, this is an admirable first effort and has decent bones. A few suggestions:

1. **Reduce the hyperbole** — characterizing a pre-college program as “once-in-a-lifetime” seems questionable at best. You want to tell them that you’re still interested, but not seem desperate.

2. **Remove the puzzle metaphor** — the point of an LOCI is to be succinct, a final push for you to articulate why you’re a good fit. Waxing eloquent with extended metaphors is something for your initial application, if at all.

3. **Talk about specific program offerings and connect your updates to them** *(devote each paragraph to a specific update/program offering matchup).* For example, maybe there’s something more specific you could say about the program in the USACO —&gt; data structures —&gt; AI progression. 

4. I suggest you **nix the final paragraph entirely.** While it is definitely a reflection of vulnerability, an LOCI is a place to show your strength, rather than offer excuses about how your inexperience precluded you from conveying your story. Just keep the final sentence. 

5. **Upload your physical signature as an image to the PDF when you submit** — it adds a dimension of authenticity.

Try to keep this to one side, and good luck!",2024-04-22 01:30:08
1248,t3_1ca2utf,1713763839.0,"It's been a couple days since I received my financial aid package from UCLA and it's... wow. I got nothing other than a SHIP grant which gives me less than 3k (and I don't need, as I already get healthcare from my mother's employer). No other grants, and no scholarships. This leaves me at paying \~40k a year as an in-state student, and this is on top of how I want to attend med school afterwards. 

I had already committed to UCLA before aid came out because I attended a weekend admit program and had the best time of my life there. I don't see myself attending any other school, and I truly felt like I belonged at UCLA. The only problem is that with the 40k/year and no guarantee my appeal will go through, I'm stuck (and also lost on HOW to appeal) in guaranteed piles of debt. 

My other options would be my local state school, community college, Berkeley, or Irvine, but seeing UCSB's financial aid package, I'm thinking that I'll be getting similar 0's across the board for all the UC's.

1254,t1_l0pcqew,1713764493.0,"Assuming the university has higher cost and that may be a barrier, much of it comes down to your personality. 

I think the University advantage is that your interaction with other students goes beyond the classroom. You're living with them in the dorms, eating with them in the evenings, likely sharing in recreational activities or participating in clubs. You're building strong personal relationships and also building a future professional network. These are your future colleagues and that network can be very valuable to you many years from now. Even the casualness of working in study groups or knocking on the door of someone you have a class with for help on homework is pretty valuable. When you live on campus with your classmates your academics are a way of life and you're more likely to be successful with them.

Much of what I just mentioned doesn't exist at a CC, or at least not in a manner where it's your primary focus. Succeeding at a CC or commuter school requires a lot of personal discipline and the ability to independently work through challenges. Most kids at a CC are also working part-time or living at home, which equates to two huge distractions on a daily basis. Compound that with your classmates also having similar distractions and collaborative growth tends to wither away. There's a reason many CC kids never finish....academics are secondary to other life priorities. Immersing yourself on a University campus keeps your studies as the main focus.",2024-04-22 01:41:33

Other things which can make a difference are that I like to explore a lot, like I am that friend who goes on weird side quests etc and maybe I love nature and wildlife (+ hiking etc).

Colleges: UCSC, UMD, Purdue, RPI, (perhaps Vtech??), Occidental

(i'll try to keep it brief)

**UCSC:**

\-pros:

* in state tuition (\~40k/year w/living)
* got into engineering college
* close to silicon valley so lots of opportunities??

\-cons:

* feels like I might as well go SJSU
* not ranked super high
* housing issues?

**UMD**: (don't know much about this)

pros: 

* nice surrounding area
* pretty well known school
* seems to be super strong for stem

cons: 

* out of state tuition (60k w/living)
* undecided Letters and Sciences so it'll be hard to choose a STEM major

**Purdue:**

pros:

* strong stem
* cheap (oos is like \~40k)

cons:

* Computer Info&amp;Tech major(not what I really wanted + hard to transfer ig)
* middle of nowhere

**RPI:**

pros: 

* cheap (scholarship gave a lot so it'd only be around 40k/year)
* can basically choose any major in engineering

cons:

* troy is lowkey unsafe i think
* it's super hard to tell where this school ranks because some say its good whereas others say its really bad so i dunno??

**Vtech:**

got into engineering undecided, but it's 60k/year w/living and also 3 hours away from an accessible airport. tbh i'm not considering this one too much

**Occidental:**

pros:

* can choose whatever major I want
* close relationships w/ profs cuz of small class size
* LA area? + research/intern opportunities are high
* they have a 3+2 program with caltech/columbia where I could transfer there after 3 years of occidental and get a dual degree but is 5 years of private school tuition really worth it??

cons:

* not that many profs for engineering
* heard that they were bad at addressing social issues
* 88k/year (super pricey + no scholarships)

possibly pursuing minors in math or music/the arts

additional info: 

I'm from Texas (near the Dallas area) and am kinda a majorly introverted person but am open to new experiences and friendships. in fact, im looking for that in college

im looking to do STEM + med +  extracurriculars that are goofy/bit on the nerdy side or really artsy 

I don't get any fin aid (too rich for aid, too poor to pay)

Colleges:

University of Michigan (#1 choice) ✨️❤️‍🔥🏅🏆

( LSA + Honors), possibly living with family, FULL PAY (w/ housing around 78k), REALLY EXPENSIVE 

fell in love with the school + great housing

USC (waiting for honors) 💫🎉 🌅

NMSC FINALIST package (half tuition), need to pay (60k per year), LA location + campus opportunities 

CWRU ⛲️👾💓

32k scholarship (around 55k per year to pay), proximity to research/medical 

love their tech/research/innovation motivated nature/opportunities 

USCD 👐🎓🎲

nothing as of rn (full pay), great/really strong academics, not sure about campus vibes

UT Austin (neuroscience, no honors) 🎶💥🎗

waiting for research related stuff, in state fees (30k per year),  i like the campus

UT Dallas (neuroscience) 🧩🫥🪄

Honors program/housing, full ride NMSC + additional extracurricular benefits, have done research here = connections, opp for study abroad/research/additional med opportunities 

dont like the campus much, not many other extracurricular opportunities, (too close to home??)



In general, from my side, I'm looking for really good academics with prestige (helpful to stand out against other applicants??), good social life (because i really need to get out more) and campus extracurriculars (sports and arts, even if i dont really do sports), and in general, a place where I can do research/premed and other nerdy stuff and have fun before med/grad school.

1285,t1_l0pi6c5,1713768147.0,"Be aware that rankings are little more than marketing for students. Schools and publications intentionally make it seem like all the best, highest paying employers are fighting each other to get to students at the top universities. This is almost pure bullshit. But I get where you're coming from. How else do you compare schools? I've got an answer for you! 

There are some employers that recruit through a narrow network at specific schools, but it is a very small number of employers. The vast majority of employers want to hire confident students with a little experience (internships/research) that earned a respectable GPA at a reputable, accredited school. 

That's literally the important part....attend a reputable, accredited school and do well there. Amazon/Apple won't see a difference on your resume if you have a 3.9 at ASU or UW. They'll hire students from either school and will pay them the exact same salary. Of equal importance, a 3.9 ASU student will be more attractive than a 3.1 CMU student. Being a top performer is far more valuable than attending a top institution.

A lot of hiring is more geography based. Employers like hiring from colleges they know well and may have a relationship with. If you want to live in Wisconsin or work in Chicago, moving to UW could offer a slight advantage. If you want to work in the Bay Area, NY, or Singapore, any school will work. You'll have to seek out companies in that area instead of having them show up at your career fair, which isn't a big deal. 

As someone who greatly values avoiding debt, if I were in your shoes, I would stay at ASU and focus on my grades and getting an internship. Graduating with a 3.75 from ASU will get you interviews at great companies. Graduating with a 2.9 from anywhere, won't.",2024-04-22 02:42:27

Your younger brother better be very smart academically.

There's merit scholarships .... and the other side is financial aid scholarships. I'll just focus on the latter as I don't know much about merit scholarships for Internationals.

Some schools give financial aid to international as well. Top schools famous for being ""need blind"" to internationals (as in school doesn't care whether you ask for money or not) are Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Yale, Brown, Dartmouth, Amherst, and Bowdoin.

But all those schools are ridiculously difficult to get in as an international. Schools like Princeton will pay for everything from plane ticket to food to travel but ... it's rank 1 in the US for a reason. We are talking about the most selective schools in the country.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, other than that, if you need financial aid as international, you will face tougher competition as many schools are 'need aware'. 'Need aware' means school considers a candidate's ability to pay when making decisions. Your brother better have the stats for the schools to be convinced it's worth investing in your brother over someone else who is willing to pay full. These schools are places like Stanford, Columbia, Duke, etc. But if you get into these schools, then you will automatically get more than full ride (like the above schools). I know my friend from Columbia graduated with $6k in his bank account (his family is also poor); the school provided him with food and housing in the winter break as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I know many liberal art colleges in the US like Wesleyan give financial aid to Internationals as well. But again, these are going to be all part of 'need aware'.

Essentially, as an International, your younger brother better have top stats to be considered if your brother wants to study for free. It's the US taxpayer money + school's own money funding an international end of day.

I'm talking all A's + high test scores + bunch of AP classes + bunch of extra curriculars and volunteer work + tournament/competition wins. And lots of prayers. Given your financial situation, you need US schools to pay you at least full ride. I mean it because it's generally the top privates who have the money to give this much money to Internationals; your brother will need to compete against other International candidates who might have won Olympiad and so forth.

&amp;#x200B;

There's definitely schools that will accept students with extremely high stats through merit scholarships. I don't know much about that for Internationals.

&amp;#x200B;

The general theme is: US only wants the best of the best. If US is confident your younger brother is the best of the best (or has the potential), then US will invest in your younger brother. And of course admissions are holistic. Location matters. If your family is extremely poor and resources are limited.. the expectations are very different from when your family is affluent and has all the resources in the world. After all, a student being bright despite coming from a poor background is much more amazing over a student who is bright coming from a privileged background. But regardless, your younger brother better be someone who looks like someone worth investing in from the eyes of the collges.",2024-04-22 04:26:50

For undergrad, Harvard CS is one of the best degrees to have in CS. For grad school, Harvard CS is not the place to be.

Harvard CS undergrad is extremely good and will open you doors almost as much as doing CS at MIT. It's unfair but it is what it is.

Also, Harvard undergrads can cross register and take courses at MIT (though I'm not sure if the courses for CS would count).

So about CS undergrad being good at Harvard? It's good at Harvard. Don't confuse engineering for CS. CS != Engineering and Harvard CS undergrads do very well.

It also helps companies like Facebook had its CEOs come from Harvard.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, Harvard undergrad for CS is good. Harvard grad for CS is not that good.

Since you are undergrad, you don't have to worry.

&gt;but I am having a hard time seeing the benefits of a Harvard education outside of prestige.

You will straight out have higher chance of getting job interviews in this field. You will still need to make projects but given equal resumes, you will get a call for a coding screen. And what matters is getting that coding screen for internship. Because once you have the coding screen, it's all Leetcode anyways.

Harvard is so prestigious that at least for CS (I do not know for other fields), you will get essentially the same opportunities as someone who studied CS at schools like MIT in the industry. This is mostly because Computer 'Science' is a 'science' unlike engineering and thus benefits from the fact Harvard has world class math and physics grad school.",2024-04-22 05:26:05

i’m a hs senior who also isn’t a u.s. citizen and got into a few top colleges (harvard, yale, princeton, cornell, duke, etc) and i wanted to offer some advice :)

1. kids who aren’t cracked get in all the time! i didn’t consider myself cracked (i had cooking club as an ec and included my roblox yt channel lmaooo) especially looking at the profiles of others, yet, I still managed to get good results. 

2. comparison is the thief of joy. i’d recommend trying to stay off these subreddits and avoid watching college decision reaction vids/stat breakdowns on yt

3. it is wayyyy too early for you to start worrying about all this. i didn’t start thinking about college until my junior year of hs and even then i still chilled and enjoyed my time there. 

4. please don’t think about things to do to “maximize your chances.” my biggest piece of advice would be to find what ecs and things genuinely interest you and pursue those as much as possible. this is good for a few reasons: colleges can see that genuine passion, your writing is a LOT better when you truly care about what you’re writing, and if you don’t end up at a “top college,” you don’t view the time you spent pursuing these activities as a waste bc u genuinely enjoyed them

5. TAKE THE SAT. ik ik i just said don’t worry about college stuff so early but i really recommend that everyone takes the sat and aims for at least a 1450+ if shooting for top colleges. despite not having “cracked ecs,” i think my grades and stats definitely helped me stand out to these colleges

1. Middlebury

* Gave me A LOT of financial aid. It’s still not a full ride, I still have to pay 12k but some of it is is covered by work-study pay and by this scholarship I have but it’s only 1k.
* I’m also worried about the location. I’ve heard it’s very isolated and im from a predominantly Hispanic region of Florida so I think I will get a huge culture shock given that there’s not a lot of diversity in midd apparently. I’m not used to a small town but I’m sure with time I’ll adjust.
* It is a really good university and I worry I will feel bad for turning it down but I’m conflicted on whether midd is the one for me. They sent me handwritten letters and this cute scarf thingy 🥲

1. honors program at a local cc

* a well known honors program at my community college where a lot of ppl have transferred to top universities like mit, yale, princeton etc after 2 years
* my dream has been Yale since I started hs, but I don’t know if it’s worth going through another 2 years in the same process. my sat scores weren’t that good in the past and I know that I have plenty of time to work on that because of the fact that I have 2 years.
* I will save a LOTT of money bc everything is paid during my 2 years there. I plan to go to law school / higher education which I’m sure is substantially more expensive so if I can save money now it would be great.

1. Waitlist spot at Vanderbilt

* Vanderbilt is one of my top choices and honestly if I get off the waitlist I will definitely commit bc I think the financial aid should be abt the same as midd if not more because of my financial situation.
* I still have to commit somewhere anyways since the decision will come after may 1st

Any advice or tips on this are highly appreciated I really don’t know whether I should give MDC honors a chance but it would mean I’d have to go through the college application all over again.

/1. Top piece of advice: target, target, target.  Real targets, not dreams. I see too many families (and I say families, because it's often parents pushing for it rather than students) ONLY applying to  prestige  reach schools with single digit acceptance rates, and then being crushed when they don't get in. There are so many fantastic schools out there that may not have HYPSM or T20 (or 50, or 100) brand recognition or which never make the lists, but offer a fabulous undergraduate education and experience that  might be perfect for YOU. 


/2.  Visit if you possibly can. Sooooo many folks change their mind about a place they loved on paper but turn out to hate in person, and vice versa. Don't go through the application process if you genuinely don't like a place (even if it is ""famous""). 



3. ROI is about far more than salary on graduation. Those 4 years should be about personal growth as much as, if not more than, career plans. Where do you think you can really develop as a human as well as ""learning for earning""? 



4. If you plan to major in a niche subject (eg performing arts) be sure to get mentoring/advice from somebody who knows how those application processes work - it's often quite different, and some school counselors may not be as aware of the specifics for those majors (eg drama and music need completely different resume formatting). 



5. Follow the money! That is also part of targeting. Be sure to apply to some schools where you are likely to get good financial support. When the time comes, that may be what makes the decision, and it's good to have that as an option.




6. Spend Jr and Sr years being a person, not a resume. It's easy to tell who does things just for college apps and who does things because they are intellectually curious and committed.

Something to consider is the huge advantage that harvard students have in grad school apps or job apps. Harvard will always stand out on a resume.

My PI at harvard was the PI of many people who taught at the grad schools I applied to. This was an exception experience bc my PI is exceptional even among harvard faculty, but that's the type of thing you can find. Rec letters matter a lot for certain grad school programs and having ones from well known and well connected PIs will provide you a lot of access. Additionally, you'll meet an amazing community of really driven people. I personally keep going to the best schools I can at each to keep my options open for my life post school. 

Don't underestimate how strong Harvard's name is/the names of the professors. Depending on you major/concentration, you might not have to deal with the competitive BS. I avoided it and did less competitive things like the radio (when interviewing me a few professors/potential employers thought it was cool).

I'm deciding between umd (in state) and cornell CAS for math! I honestly have no idea what I want to do after graduation, but I think there's a good chance I'll want to do grad school.

Because I'm in state, umd is \~60k cheaper per year (\~30k/yr vs \~90k/yr) but I'm very fortunate that my family can (somewhat comfortably) afford either.

I know cornell is obviously much more prestigious, and I also loved their math department more and I know it's much easier to double major in certain areas like CS there (which I've heard is really hard at UMD). however, I've gone to both admitted student days, and although I didn't feel too strongly for/against either school, for some reason during my maryland tour I felt like I was touring my future school whereas at cornell it just didn't feel right; I just couldn't really see myself there. Ithaca also felt really isolating to me, when I was walking around downtown it just felt really lonely to me, even though I was surrounded by so many students/families.

I feel like Cornell would offer me a better education and set me up better for grad school and/or employment, but I just don't feel excited to go. UMD offers more of the traditional college experience I've always wanted, but ultimately, I'm just really scared to turn down an irrefutably better school out of pure speculation that I'll be happier elsewhere.

Intended major: Anthropology with a minor in biology (plan to pursue archeology)

**Temple University**

TU Pros:

* Philadelphia is a great city and despite the surrounding neighborhood the campus is mostly safe
* Admitted me early and gave me a 56k merit scholarship 
* In the top 100 of university's 
* Has a campus in Rome 
* Does lots of research around archeology 
* Strong academics in the humanities and sciences 
* Very diverse and very LGBTQ friendly
* Close to my home state
* Have family there 

TU Cons:

* Neighborhood does have safety concerns
* Philadelphia is really expensive if I chose to live off campus
* No free transport to center city only half off SEPTA passes
* Not as strong of an academic school as Pitt 
* My dad there so I've consistently been to the campus and events throughout my life so it doesn't feel like a different experience for me

**University of Pittsburgh**

Pitt Pros:

* My top choice (I feel in love with the school when I visited and the opportunities for research)
* Also a great city, definitely different vibe from Philly and is smaller/less crowded
* Cheaper city if I wanted to live of campus 
* I've only visited once or twice so it would be more new experiences
* Strong study abroad program
* Strong academics especially for life sciences
* Has research opportunities through campus and study abroad
* Higher rank being a top 50 school 
* LGBTQ friendly 
* I like the sports teams so I'd have events to enjoy

Pitt Cons:

* Further away from home
* Don't know financial aid I will get (Based on income and what my parents have seen they are absolutely willing to pay if I get the need based aid) 
* Still would be more expensive than Temple and I do not want to put my parents in debt no matter how willing they are to pay
* less diverse 

&amp;#x200B;

These are all the pros and cons I could come up with but there really isn't much about their archeology research and studies are at each university. I plan to visit both again and try to get a visit set up with their anthropology departments. I just want to know if I'd be insane to leave the scholarship Temple is given me even though Pitt is my top school.",2024-04-22 10:21:42

UCSD major: Math-econ joint major, will try transferring into Data Science

Career options: I don't mind either staying broad within tech or specializing, which is why I have listed both as pros. **I don't mind IT jobs as long as they are technical.** BU would allow a wider range of career options while UCSD might force me to specialize a bit. I guess my main question is what are the chances that the UCSD econ-math major would force me into a non-tech job? Because I know that with UCSD,

1. I'll probably have to fill in my CS gaps on my own (which I think I'm capable of doing but still leaves an element of risk).
2. Employers probably favor CS degrees over econ-math, at least for regular IT/tech jobs.
3. Quant roles have high barriers to entry meaning I could be stuck with a less technical finance job

**Boston University**

BU Pros:

* Guaranteed CS major
* ""Scholarly"" location
* Wider range of career options (standard CS roles + everything mentioned below for UCSD)

BU Cons:

* Expensive
* CS and STEM not as strong
* Not very competitive compared to MIT students next door

**UCSD**

UCSD Pros:

* Strong STEM
* Nice location and weather
* Cheaper
* Career options are more specialized (quant, fintech, data science, etc.)

UCSD Cons:

* Virtually impossible to transfer into CS (don't plan to)
* Data Science is not guaranteed. Only 1 chance for Data Science before the ""[Selective Major](https://students.ucsd.edu/academics/advising/majors-minors/selective.html)"" system gets implemented.

&gt;he’s planning to major in a combination of CS, business, and math

Stanford. Stanford is the only one here that is world class for all 3 at grad school.

&gt;However, I’m worried that since Williams isn’t a well-known “target school” for CS and has a tiny CS department, he’d be missing out on insane coursework, research, and internship opportunities that could be found somewhere like Stanford or UPenn.

Someone from Blind posted that his brighter brother attended Williams while he himself attended a state school reputable in CS. The one in Williams is not in FAANG while he himself worked in FAANG and is currently in Two Sigma.

Apparently his brighter brother was not able to get code screens and online assessments at top tech as easily. Just do that nature, Stanford.

While this field (which I'm sure you are well aware) is all Leetcode, you still need to get a recruiter to hook up a coding screen with an interviewer. It doesn't matter much 4\~5 years out but why not.

&gt;Furthermore, the main reason why he’s considering UPenn is that he’s hoping to get involved in its business opportunities or even switch to Wharton.

Two very different fields. While Wharton edges out in finance, Stanford degree itself will get you a foot to the door too.

I would look at either UPenn and Stanford. And since your brother seems to dislike both campus, Stanford.

In terms of education? Expect it to be horrible experience. Welcome to research universities. I enjoyed looking at this video about a salty Stanford CS grad about Stanford: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SiFgB1lGxw)

1544,t3_1caeol8,1713802060.0,"Hi, I am really struggling with college decisions at the moment and would really appreciate some feedback from people who know about these universities or have attended. I recently got accepted into Columbia, Amherst, and Rice and am struggling with deciding where to go. For context I want to double major in stats and econ and potentially go into actuary work after graduation (I'm not 100% sure though). 

Amherst: 

Pros: 

\- small class sizes ( I like the individual attention) 

\- easy classes for my major so it would be easy to double major (I want to major in stats and econ so I can potentially go into actuary work)

\- since it has an open curriculum I feel that it would be easier to study abroad 

\- the campus was very pretty

Cons: 

\- It's in a small town ( I think I like a city setting more) 

\- the student body is really small

\- the campus was really quiet when I went for BAM (I'm not a huge party person but I though more people would at least be chatting with one another) 

\- it's really chilly 

\- No advance ballet classes on campus ( I have been dancing for 10+ years now and ballet really helps be to de-stress but I would have to fight for limited ballet classes at UMASS Amherst/ I'm not sure if UMASS Amherst even has that great of a ballet program) 

\- no pep band

\- bad food 

Rice:

Pros: 

\- Warm weather 

\- I loved the people that I met while I was there

\- no language requirement 

\- gorgeous campus 

\-  a silly pep band 

\- fun traditions/overall just seemed like a happy place 

\- good food

\- perfect student body size 

Cons: 

\- no advanced ballet classes 

\- Stats is in the Engineering department so I think I would have to take the engineering pre-recs 

\- harder to double major 

\- I will get kicked off campus for a year and am a bit scared of finding a place to live and driving in Houston

\- Idk if I want to live in Texas after college 

\-  I'm worried I won't have as many internship opportunities if I go to Rice as opposed to Amherst or Columbia 

\- harder to study abroad

Columbia: 

Pros: 

\- Ivy 

\-  Has great ballet classes offered through Barnard 

\- internship opportunities available during the semesters (not just over the summer)

\- NYC!!

\- I could get a single freshman year 

\- I think the core is interesting (the swim test seems very silly and I really like the idea of taking classes that I normally wouldn't take) 

\- Great job placement rate 

\- a fun pep band 

\- I LOVE the campus and location 

\- More opportunities in general 

\- they have really cool ballet clubs 

\- they have lots of options for dining 

Cons: 

\- the stress cultures that everyone talks about (this is the major one)

\- I'm worried about people being pretentious 

\- the core would get in the way of double majoring

\- the major requirements are a lot harder here than at Rice or Amherst 

\- It might be hard to study for Actuary exams 

\- Idk how hard it is to get into certain clubs 

\- That NYC isn't that safe 

\- That Columbia is getting a bad reputation and it might hurt my chances of getting a job in the future 

\- That the student body is really cut-throat and competitive with one another 

\- large class sizes and lack of individual attention (I'm scared of failing because I don't understand something and the professor isn't willing to work with me)

- Academics:  You'll have lots of options to creatively major and pick your interests.  You can double major, minor, or even modify your major.   You also don't have to major in economics to do finance/IB.   You'll also have the opportunity to really get to know your Professors and do cutting edge Research if that is your interest.    The  Economics Department is great and the CS department is wonderful.   The student vibe is also very collaborative.  
  
-Internships/Career:  Dartmouth is over-represented given its size especially in finance.  Dartmouth has two recent secretaries of the Treasury, former CEO of Goldman and many leaders are Dartmouth grads.  You'll have plenty of options for IB but also for PE and some HF like Citadel.  Also if you are interested in quantitative finance, several of the firms actively recruit as well.   The D-Plan is also really helpful for off-campus internships.

I’ve heard a LOT of positive things about Bryn Mawr. For example, the people there are supposed to be accepting and collaborative rather than competitive. The quality of life there (dorms and food) is hard to beat too. 

However, I’ve also heard stuff about a toxic social atmosphere due to how small the student population is. I’m not necessarily unused to this, right now I’m at a school where everyone knows everything about other people’s business and you’re weird if you don’t. I’ve never been interested in dumb drama over who’s with who, so I guess I don’t want that to extend to college as well. I also heard that people can be unaccepting when it comes to “controversial” opinions. I am the least political person on the planet so if that is going to be the main topic of discussion then that may be a problem. 

Anyways, these concerns are probably present at all the schools I’m considering anyway, but if you’re familiar with Bryn Mawr then let me know if these are valid or exaggerated in any way!

That said, they do like to see some evidence (in how you spend your time outside of class) that you're actually interested in studying math/science/engineering.

Some ideas there:

* relevant clubs at school, e.g. math, robotics, rocketry, etc.
* tutoring other students in math/science/etc. if its possible to do that at your school
* volunteering for organizations like Girls Who Code, et. al.
* science fair

Competitions are fine and can demonstrate you know your stuff, but taking exams isn't actually ""doing"" anything.  If you enjoy the process of preparing for Olympiads then it's a reasonable use of your time, but don't spend all your time training for competitions if you don't actually enjoy it.",2024-04-22 12:37:43

1575,t3_1cafyp5,1713805145.0,"So I have a son and daughter a year apart in age. My daughter graduates this year, my son next year. Yesterday was my son’s NHS induction, which included the awards and college choices  for the graduating class (my daughter’s class, —she did not join NHS, though invited). 

We live in a northern suburb of Cincinnati. It is a large school district. There are two high schools, each graduating 600+ students. The district is generally ranked highly, though not as highly as some. There were about eighty kids in the 2024 NHS class out of about 650 graduating. So these largely represent the best students in the class. 

What was striking to me was that nearly all of them remained in-state for college and typically in this corner of the state. One was attending Notre Dame. Another USC. Two to Coastal Carolina, one to Denison. Many to Ohio State, many to MiamiU (Ohio). Two to Wittenberg. One to U of Alabama. Only one student was attending a T20 school, and no Ivies. 

These students are very intelligent. My daughter’s best friend, #6 out of 650 students, 35 ACT, 4.6 weighted, 4.0 UW, multiple ECs, AP’s committed to MiamiU for chemical engineering because they offered her a full ride. OSU offered her $3k. She did not apply to any T20 school because her parents earn too much to receive need based aid but cannot afford $90k/year under any circumstances, though she would have a shot. 

The bottom line here is that money is driving the decisions, not talent. So for those students who are disappointed in the university they are attending, don’t be. You will be attending with some of the brightest students the U.S. has, just not the richest. Similarly, those who consider themselves consigned to mediocrity because they have to attend their state’s flagship uni, don’t be surprised if some of those mediocre students leave you in the dust. There’s a spot for everyone.

Im oos for all of my options

Order of price highest to lowest:
- Penn State
- Texas A&amp;M
- Ohio State
- UMich Flint ( but after two years it would be the Ann Arbor price so wayyy more expensive after)

I haven’t done too much research on the schools so I need a little but of context maybe from others experiences about what choice is the best option. (im gonna visit all of them throughout this and next week)

Ohio State

Pros:
- Great ranking for Engineering
- Great social scene and school spirit
- Football games would be really fun from what I’ve heard
- Their scholars program seems really nice
- Like the logo

Cons:
- Have to apply to my top choice major which is mechanical engineering so I’d be competing with other students for a spot my first year

Penn state:

Pros:
- Entrance into engineering major isn’t as bad as the other options (3.0 GPA or higher)
- Well ranked engineering program
- Great student/social scene and school spirit
- Beautiful Campus from the pictures ive seen

Cons:
- expensive
- Haven’t done too much research on the school

Texas &amp;M

Pros:
- Amazing school spirit
- Top 10-20 Engineering program depending where you look online
- Weather would be a lot warmer than my other options
- Love their maroon color

Cons:
- Would have to compete with others for a spot in my too choice of engineering major or maintain a 3.75 gpa for guaranteed entry
- Not too sure about living in Texas due to its political climate, especially because TAMU is especially known for being pretty conservative, but again most colleges are all the way on the other end and TAMU could very well just be more moderate than anything

UMich Flint to Ann Arbor:

Pros:
- If I maintain a 3.0 gpa or higher I’d be able to transfer to Ann Arbor after two years

Cons:
- I’d have to live in Flint Michigan for two years
- UMich Flint itself is really low ranked so if I don’t maintain a 3.0 I’d be stuck in Flint or I’d have to transfer somewhere else
- Flint price is not the worst but Ann Arbor price is really expensive so after two years I’d have to almost double my payments

I was pretty convinced to go especially since my family was supportive of whatever i wanted to do and id be financially well off living there.

Yet before i accepted and made my mind completely i got offered a full ride at a college in my shitty home country…

I was really happy and after extreme consideration i decided i dont want to waste all this money on something i deemed unnecessary.

But it just feels so necessary now. Im rotting away in my country doing nothing exciting no social events barely any friends just barely living. The university is basically just school. I go attend lectures then leave. Never anything else.

And i feel like every second is a second of experience i can never take back

I am intending to major in Economics and Politics, with a potential interest in studying law after my undergraduate studies. While initially I was interested in doing my studies in the US, my finances played a big part in making some of my other great choices completely unfeasible. That said, my choices ultimately boiled down to Georgetown Qatar (6k/a.y; including living costs) and Sciences Po at the Reims campus (10k/a.y; including living costs) for which I received generous financial aid and merit based scholarships respectively. 

For some perspective, I am mainly concerned about the opportunities, resources, and post graduation merits associated with those two choices. I am leaning more towards Sciences Po in the moment due to its reputation and ranking  in this field as well as great alumni system and presence in Europe. However, Georgetown Qatar has provided me with a stellar financial package that I am not sure rejecting would be a sound decision.

Intended major/goal: interdisciplinary social sciences, to pre law or to the UN. I could go: LSC--&gt;Gallatin Individualized Studies OR CGS--&gt;Sociology

NYU Pros:

* Gallatin School of Individualized Study. If I transfer there I can have more command over my major.
* Large liberal arts undergrad population?
* Cityscape. I loved riding the subways and strolling the streets while I was visiting.
* Urban setting. Possibly helpful for urban studies.
* Diversity. Large international student population. I was an international student who went to high school in the US so I may feel more comfortable?
* Valuable study abroad experience
* Close to UN headquarters. Idek if this is worth considering or if it's valuable at all.

NYU Cons:

* Cityscape. I'm worried it'll feel more lonely than fun strolling through NYC if I can't make friends. Is this a legit concern? Any experience/advice is welcome!
* Loud. It seems that there are few quiet study spaces around NYU. Is this true? Should this be a major concern?
* **Opportunity. I often hear that you get as much as you put in the clubs/social life in NYU. This certainly applies to business/art majors. But for a sociology-leaning student, are there valuable opportunities out there for me to find at all?**

BU Pros:

* More quiet, academic environment. The campus is well organized and aesthetic (vs the musty roads always under construction in NYU).
* Opportunity. It seems that the clubs are more accessible in BU since there is a campus and events/booths are very visible. I may have less trouble finding community there.
* 100 day gap semester. I could use that extra time to broaden my real world experience before entering college, such as through community service, jobs, creative writing, or picking up useful life skills.

BU Cons:

* Less urban feel. I don't know how much opportunity it offers for social work/urban studies experience.
* Social life. I'm worried that because the campus is set and we see the same person every day, friend groups may be stagnant and resistant to change.

**I think my main concern is whether I will feel more welcomed in NYU or in BU. I am not a cliquey person, and I tend to be in multiple friend groups based on common interest (writing, Kpop, music). I don't mind a set friend group but I'm worried it tends to be easy for me to get marginalized. I also love the city, and NYC gives me that legit feel. But I don't know if I am romanticizing NYC and if this holds any substance at all.**

I don’t really care about school size, but W&amp;M has a somewhat better teacher to student ratio.
I like the W&amp;M campus and liberal arts atmosphere more, where I also get to be a Monroe Scholar. There also seems to be more internship opportunities there. 
My housing will be nice and new. 
It’s near Norfolk and the beach.

Why UMD:
It’s closer to home, with all of its conveniences and access to relations. If times get tough, I could commute.

I'd say both Colby and Carleton are comparable in educational quality. One important thing to note is that Colby is a lot more similar to Midd than Carleton is, in almost every metric.

I'd also say that the party/alcohol scene at Colby and Carleton are going to be extremely similar. The ""alcohol culture"" polls for Colby (https://www.niche.com/colleges/colby-college/campus-life/) and Carleton (https://www.niche.com/colleges/carleton-college/campus-life/) are almost identical when compared to Middlebury (https://www.niche.com/colleges/middlebury-college/campus-life/). I, as well as many people I know, don't party at all.

I would say the defining difference in Colby and Carleton are their student cultures:  Colby is sporty / outdoorsy and Carleton is more quirky / down to earth. Both colleges will be identical in terms of outcomes (i.e. very good), so if cost isn't a concern I'd simply go to the one you like more superficially.

Not entirely sure what professional career to aim for, but was thinking EITHER something on industry R&amp;D with CS+Physics  OR the high-end careers, but less technical careers of management consulting or finances. I, personally, enjoy research quite a lot, but don't want to end up solely in academia, so this is also a question about life choices in general, I guess (I am also possibly considering UIUC for CS+Physics).  


The options are vast, I just want to make sure I am making the best choice - or committing to a school I won't regret!  


1) Columbia SEAS  


Pros:  
\- Amazing Physics Department; the Physics Research offered also seems great

\- Good CS program from what I hear

\- I enjoy the idea of the Core contributing to my overall education

\- Good reputation for careers in finance

Cons:

\- People say it may feel lonely at times

\- Pretentious (?)

\- The whole story with USNEWS reputation and protests - not that I am too upset about these events in particular, but the fact that these may be signs of deeper systematic problems at  CU.

&amp;#x200B;

2) CMU

Pros:

\- Good mathematical sciences department, from what I understand - there will be many opportunities for research in fields that interest me

\- Career placement seems great for TECH jobs even in the Mellon College of Sciences

\- I like the academic and research vibe

Cons:

\- Poor student life (?)

\- Pretentious (?) 

&amp;#x200B;

3) Northwestern

Pros:

\- Great Student life  
\- Good technical specialties, especially practice-oriented projects

\- Good for placement into exclusive careers

\- I like the whole idea of crazy double majors

Cons:

\- Physics and CS are less well regarded

&amp;#x200B;

4) Duke

Pros:

\- Prestige

\- FUN student life; amazing conditions, beautiful campus

\- Prestige (?)

\- great interdisciplinary research and initiatives like DukeEngage

cons:

\- less tech-oriented

\- the vibe is more laid back (is this true?)

\- in the middle of nowhere

I got into the College of Arts and Sciences for both Cornell and UCLA but might end up switching to their engineering schools down the road since I'm leaning towards software engineering as my major. 

Here's a list of pros and cons in no specific order. I'm not highly considering cost because my parents are willing to pay full tuition for both of them, although UCLA will be slightly cheaper.

*UCLA*

Pros:

* Better weather
* Closer to home
* Really good dining halls
* Four years guaranteed housing
* Strong academics (though maybe not as strong as Cornell?)
* Lots of extracurricular and internship opportunities given location and school resources

Cons:

* HUGE student body
* Hard to get around without a car, which I'm not bringing
* Competitive classes graded on a curve
* Some classes built for weeding
* Quarter system moves fast
* Might be harder to switch into their engineering school later on

*Cornell*

*Pros:*

* Ivy league prestige and connections + name recognition
* I'm considering a CS major which is in Cornell's CAS, so I wouldn't have to switch schools at Cornell like I would at UCLA if I choose this route
* Switching schools isn't as hard
* Love the medium-biggish student body size
* Rush is in the second semester
*  Beautiful campus

*Cons:*

* Hate that outside of the university and college town, there's nothing around
* The weather is awful; constant cloudy weather makes me depressed
* Grade deflation
* Won't be able to go home for shorter holidays
* Lack of 'big city' activities
* Not a lot of school spirit other than hockey games
* No guaranteed housing after sophomore year
* Higher price tag

I think I would be a lot happier at UCLA because of the weather and location, and it might be a better fit for my personality. However, I'm struggling to pick it over Cornell because of the name brand and that I'd probably be able to have a great time there as well. I appreciate input from anyone and everyone.

I thought I could finesse my way through computer science and .. yes I have been and currently have a 4.0 but I’m miserable.

I plan on building my experience in SWE but majoring in something I want. Idgaf if the degree is “useless” 

How hard will it be to transfer from CS to philosophy? Would AOs look at this poorly if I transfer into something vastly different ??? I just can’t take CS anymore. I am not built for anything stem related.

1770,t3_1can3fb,1713822484.0,"Hi! I'm a senior torn between colleges at the moment.

I've narrowed down my decision to UC Berkeley (OOS) and a top LAC on the east coast (think WASP). The cost of both schools for me is the same and thankfully not an issue. But after visiting both, I'm even more torn because they're so different. For reference, I'm looking to double major in humanities/natural sciences and pursue grad(possible law) school.

Berkeley
Pros:
- admitted to L&amp;S so flexibility on major
- large research university -&gt; more opportunities if you look for them
- more diversity in people and student groups
- location -&gt; close to sf and many things to do in the surrounding area
- great weather (im from the east coast so the weather to me is amazing)
- more traditional college experience

Cons:
- might be TOO big -&gt; overcrowding, harder to build connections with professors
- competitive for opportunities (clubs, research, internships)
- as a public school, resources are scarcer
- grade deflation -&gt; would have to work harder to be competitive for grad school
- more dangerous area

LAC
Pros:
- more undergrad focus and resources 
- easier to get opportunities/guidance
- more interaction with professors
- flexibility of major
- more collaborative culture
- great grad school placement (or so i've heard)

Cons:
- very small, which makes me worried about finding my group socially
- kind of isolated, not much to do in the immediately surrounding area
- east coast weather sucks during winter (seasonal depression is unfortunately real), though i can (and have been my whole life) deal with it

Because they're essentially opposites, I can't help but feel like I'm giving up something to choose the other. I'm the type of person that can probably fit in most places, but I feel like I'd be more socially fulfilled at Berk, while being more intellectually fulfilled at a close-knit LAC. It's just the small size and lack of stuff to do off-campus that make me hesitant.

I'm leaning toward the LAC because my impression is that it's a better option for grad school prospects, but I wonder if the outcome would be meaningfully different at either? They are both great institutions, but I'm a little sad about giving up the west coast experience. Opinions on either would be helpful! Thanks!

I was fortunate enough to receive admissions to the first three colleges (eagerly waiting on LA) and was looking for some advice in the decision making process. Note: LA is not out yet and obviously I don’t know if I got in but it would be better to plan for it and then just void that part of the plan if I got denied than not plan for LA at all. I don’t mean to come off as spoiled or pretentious in any way and I apologize if it comes off that way at any point during this post.

I am premed (pre-PA to be specific) transferring after 2 years at my local community college. I need about ~2,000 volunteer/working hours with direct Patient Care (already have about 200). I am looking to become EMT certified, which most if not all of these campuses offer.

Some background info about me: South Asian male, parents are family oriented (plays into how far and where they would want me to go for school) but I want to be independent and live further to gain better personal skills.

Current ranking goes:
1. Cal/UCD
2. UCSD/UCLA

Cal: Admitted to the CoLS, Molecular Cell Biology with Immunology Track

- Pros: Intense courses to prep for PA School, connections with UCSF, 45 minutes from home, tons of research opportunities, the name can get my foot through certain doors, prestige to make my parents proud (and give them cute license plate frames :)), etc.

- Cons: Grade deflation, expensive housing, homelessness on and around campus, near Oakland.

UCSD: Biochemistry at 7th College

- Pros: Good biology program, 7th college is very nice and updated, good weather, better housing price and options.

- Cons: Far from home, no other family friends nearby.

UCD: Global Disease Biology

- Pros: Already have a housing spot from one of my friends (4 guys in 2 rooms, 5 of us for fall quarter), lots of friends that I know very well (damn near my whole friend group), 1.5 hours away from home, Student Run Clinics, hard but not AS hard as Cal and UCLA, cozy town vibes, very nice gym and athletic opportunities.

- Cons: Heard it gets extremely hot and cold during seasons, too many people I know which could distract me, offered housing situation is not ideal, major is not the exact one I wanted but not that big of a deal.

UCLA: Molecular Cell Developmental Biology

- Pros: Has a medical school, big city vibes, perfect amount of friends, good biology department, prestige.

- Cons: Housing is ridiculous, grade deflation, may not be as many premed opportunities (?).

I hope I made this bearable for all who decide to read, and I thank you all for taking the time out of your day to look into this.

I appreciate and value any and all criticism and advice that is given (ie. which departments may be better, premed opportunities, housing options, etc.) and once again thank you all for taking the time to read!",2024-04-22 17:54:26

* New Haas admits spend a weekend together in South Lake Tahoe
* In California, not far from home

For some context, I’m a student in Ontario and I applied to a bunch of US schools for aerospace engineering and got into University of Arizona under a $96,000 scholarship for the next 4 years. I also just got into University of Waterloo for its mech-eng coop program, still waiting for bursary. (The cost of attendance will be very similar for either school, so financially I’m not too worried) My goal has always been to move to the US because of better aerospace engineering opportunities compared to Canada (and so I can save money on housing &amp; gas).

I got the acceptance from Arizona in November, while I just recently got a response from Waterloo. (Which sucks because the latest time I can make a decision for a US school is May 1st, which is national admittance day down south.)

So, in a time crunch- I accepted UArizona about 2 weeks ago seeing that it was my best option at the time. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a wonderful school with a whole lot of opportunities. But, I’m afraid that my quick decision might ruin my access to career opportunities for the next 4 years.

Going into aerospace/mech eng- my biggest concern is landing a job during or after Uni. Without hands-on experience, I know it’s hard to land a fulfilling job especially in a scope like Aerospace. Is Waterloo’s co-op program as good as they say? Can it provide me equal if not better access to co-ops in the aerospace field? If I go to Arizona, is there going to be a clear gap in opportunities, support, and resources?

Let me know what you think and I greatly appreciate your support!

TLDR: I want a job in aerospace eng, is Waterloo a great school for that or should I just go to America for school?",2024-04-22 19:00:33

-more competitive atmosphere than the other ivy leagues(or so I heard)

-Not the best for CS

-The food isn't the best

-would love a nice social scene but I’ve heard it’s not the best

-heard that it’s difficult to cross register?

**Duke**
**Pros:**

-more specific cs classes so lots of variety

-more collaborative environment

-t10 school so good reputation

-great for public policy

-nice clubs related to cs for social good

-food is AMAZING

-love the campus 

**Cons:**

-again not sure how good the cs here is

-not as prestigious as ivy leagues

-not sure how the surrounding town is

-not sure if i’d fit into greek life scene but am not super against it

* I'm in-state, so I'll get in-state tuition!

HOWEVER, I'm worried I'm passing up a super great opportunity:

I got into UIUC for bioengineering, and I'm wondering if the Grainger prestige is just more worth it?

* my tuition will be OOS tuition (\~60k), and I'll have to get there by plane, which will add up
   * my family can cover most of the tuition, and I'll maybe have to take out \~12k in loans per year
* is UIUC even that great for bioengineering or is it better for the other engineering disciplines?
   * i've heard a lot about it being T5 engineering, so would that translate to better job opportunities?

my other top options are:

* UCSB as a pre-bio major
* UW as a pre-engineering major (on the bioE track) + a small scholarship
* Purdue as a cell, molecular &amp; developmental biology major + honors college

essentially, I'm wondering if I should consider UIUC, or if I should just go with what I was initially going with?

NC resident, UNC would by far be the cheapest but I did get a scholarship to Virginia Tech that makes it feasible for me to go there. I still haven’t received a financial aid offer/package from UGA but more than likely it’d be the most expensive option of the three. 
My dad is a VT alumn and I’ve grown up going to almost all the home football games, and it just holds a special place in my heart because of it. 
UGA was an unexpected acceptance for me, so I think I’m drawn to it because it’s just an interesting and different option for me. I’m just not sure how their academics stand compared to the other two. 
UNC from what I’ve heard has the most versatility for double majoring and having minors on top of that so with my current academic plan it would most likely work the best. I do worry about the academics though since I’m not perusing anything medical and that’s what they mainly are.
From the research I’ve done they all are in the top three geography programs in the south- but Google can only tell me so much.
UNC is looking to be the one- but I guess I’m hesitant if anyone thinks I’d have better opportunities elsewhere.

I used to think I was a very talented and future-focused person, but after experiencing debilitating rejections from summer programs, not even state qualifying for competitions, not winning any awards after I truly, genuinely \*thought\* that art was my only talent, I am just so done. My parents don't support me at all (literally - my brothers pay for rent and other utilities) and as the college admissions process gets nearer and nearer I feel less and less adequate. Even if I tell people I've had 3 part time jobs and 2 internships and 2 officer positions and 6 medals from random things and 3 scholarships and the list goes on, literally nothing feels enough. So many people will say, ""Well, your situation is different, so colleges will..."" will what, exactly? Literally no form of administrative guidance has been provided until one of my teachers brought the issue of my attendance up, which spurred this entire thing out of control. It's crazy because, I am supposed to still just be a kid, but for years and years after numerous incidents of homelessness, my siblings and I are expected to just know how to do shit without having any previously ordained subset of knowledge or skills. I have spent so, so, so much time trying to improve my skillset only to receive measly ""Honorable Mentions"" for scholastic art and writing awards and straight up humiliation after pouring hours and hours into Science Olympiad, Speech &amp; Debate, and writing and art competitions. It's funny because we have been so tight on money that our fridge is empty right now and I've had to beg my teachers for extensions and miss so many days of school to work part time to support my brothers and I.

Pros:

-Cheap tuitions with a scholarship

-Small class size, LAC-style experience

-Have a familiar teacher at there

-Close to NYC

Cons:

-Have a familiar teacher at there

-Aging equipment on the campus, according to some students who study there



CWRU

Pros:

-Low costs of living since it's in Cleveland

-Connections to the Cleveland Orchestra as I play classical music and to many other resources in Cleveland

-Probably the strongest school academically here

-Nice campus and awesome equipment such as the 3D Printer

- in love with the culture 

- unmatched alumni network 

- love that it is an hbcu 

-17k annual scholarship, no guarantee for additional aid 

-sends more black professionals to fortune 500 companies than any other uni

-horrible admin

-would have to blind commit or double commit with umiami (could end up losing money from deposit or paying more than umiami) 

-have to wear suit to class in business school 💀

-dc is full of opportunity and one of my fav cities

umiami:

-newer facilities/better amenities 

-$$$ lifestyle 

-58k scholarship (mix of aid and merit) 

-rich culture, may feel imposter syndrome 

-kinda hate hot weather 

-also has a good business school

-admitted to legal studies bba and global studies co major 

-not the traditional college feel at all which i prefer

-very small but close knit black community

I'm so grateful with how this all went. i know how lucky I am with how little work I had to do college application wise compared to other people who applied to like 20+ schools which is what I would have done had I not gotten in early. i know how lucky I am to get into my top choice school. i know how lucky I am that I was essentially debt free the day I got in.

In many instances, colleges are looking for Art students if they have an exceptionally strong science pre med program because they have too many applicants that want the limited spots in science.... Consider taking classes at the nearest Community college for dual credit and if you get good grades, Colleges weight for initiative you took... Start building a portfolio of your work and begin to create pieces that show talents in various media.... look into free classes in your area at local shops... like yarn shops, leather shops, and culinary shops.... Choose a digital platform and get certificates from Google trainings or Microsoft trainings that are free online... create functional art on Canva and set up a storefront on Etsy or Michael's.... Start mastering a new foreign language online.... Begin learning how to play a musical instrument well.... activities that you pursue outside of school will be looked at favorably by employers and colleges... and begin to write your story now, work on it everyday, begin a journal with daily entries and go on a strict media diet unless you are learning applying and creating..

I was able to graduate in 3 years by overloading and taking one summer class. It was the hardest thing I had ever done, I studied everyday and most waking hours. I was studying more than my classmates. I was only getting a B+ average. 

Now in my forties with a doctorate and masters and half a career under my belt, I am pretty sure I am a poor test taker. School was hard for me but I really thrived in the workplace.

Most affordably I got stamps at Wake (full+$7k/year stipend) and UFlorida with a state scholarship (full +$16k/year stipend).

I’m running out of time to appeal my financial aid to UPenn and it’s looking like I’ll be paying the 45k this year if I decide to go. I also got into a couple other top 20s where my estimated contribution was $30k/year. 

1) Is the Wharton/life science dual degree program worth it if I would come out w $200k debt?
2) if so, can I take out the student loans with only my mom as a co-signer? She has a good credit score but makes about 50k a year. My dad makes 120k but has terrible credit and 6 figure credit card debt (hence why my expected contribution is high).

I like Harvard more as a school since I hate reading and don't like the idea of the core curriculum (although I've heard it's not as bad for SEAS). But, I love New York City (more than Boston) and know the location would be helpful for networking and internships. I also prefer grade inflation, want to study abroad 1-2 times, and want a school with people that have a variety of interests (not a monoculture into one field). I never got to visit Columbia's visit (since it was closed due to the protests), but loved Harvard's campus and the area. Any help or advice is appreciated.

1986,t1_l0tye2i,1713838778.0,"Okay, I recently got my financial aid package from my school. Just based off of that I'd suggest UMiami IF you can't afford to pay for Howard if you get absolutely no aid. For my college, the base sticker price is $64,258 for the entire year. Which is split between semesters, so $32,129 per semester. After aid and loans, I only have to pay around $13k per year. 

Now, Howard's tuition is lower than UMiami, if what I looked up is correct...

Howard: 
Base Tuition = $55,704
Per Semester = $27,852 (Divide Base Tuition By 2)
Tuition for 4 years = $222,816

UMiami:
Base Tuition = $88,440
Per Semester = $44,220 (Divide Base Tuition By 2)
Scholarship &amp; Merit Aid Per Semester = $29,000 (Divide rough 58,000+ By 2)
Tuition After Scholarship &amp; Aid Per Semester = $15,220
Tuition for 4 years = $121,760

So, if you can afford to pay $27,852 per semester without any aid, I'd say go ahead and apply to Howard since you seem to prefer that school. But if the financial aid would be a big help, apply to UMmaimi. 

Though if you can, you can put down a deposit to Howard first and then decide when your financial aid package for that school comes out.",2024-04-22 22:19:38

1997,t3_1cathzg,1713839578.0,"At the beginning of my college process, I opted for REA to a HYPSM and got flat out rejected. Not even a deferral. Usually being plain rejected REA is said to be a sign that you “never had a chance” anyway. It killed my confidence and made me feel like I was delusional and had no chance for other top schools. I had to fill out 27 more applications afterwards. It felt awful. 

I saw several kids getting into Northwestern and Amherst and other schools with significant ED boosts and regretted so heavily that I aimed for gold when I could’ve happily and easily settled for silver. 

And the rejections just came rolling in. Even from public schools with over 50% acceptance rates. Not even kidding. I kept getting rejected left and right, and with every rejection came additional depression and insecurity as I watched my peers be accepted or stay content with their ED schools. 

Now, at the end of this process, I ended up getting into a HYPSM. After being rejected/waitlisted from a majority of my schools, with many of my decisions making zero sense. I was waitlisted by my in-state public with a 57% AR (and I put a lot of time into that application too 😒). 

But I regret not taking that initial ED still. I got into UPenn Wharton and was just thinking about the ED boost that Penn has (most admits I’ve met at least for Wharton were taken  in ED) and wondering how much heartbreak and sadness I could’ve saved myself if I had just gone with that initially. Obviously it’s not as much of a boost as somewhere like Northwestern (where they literally almost take 1/3 kids in ED), but it still would’ve been a higher chance and saved me so many tears had I gotten in. 

So, my advice to juniors: if there’s a school that offers ED that you’d be happy to go to (with higher ED rates), consider taking that route. Save yourself the heartbreak. Even after getting into these schools I still feel this element of sadness from carrying so many rejections and my seemingly random results sort of discredit the acceptances I did get.",2024-04-22 22:32:58

Major:  International business at UofSC and UTK, it would be economics and a Spanish minor at UCSB

UofSC Pros:

I was accepted into the Capstone program for UofSC. I really like the UofSC campus. Great for my major. Good sports.

Cons:

I am not so sure about Columbia as a whole. Not that well ranked. Al ot of people seem unhappy with it. 



UTK Pros:

UTK has a nice campus too and Knoxville is super cute. Good business. Good balance of college town and city. Sports. Well regarded. Pretty campus. Cheapest.

Cons:

Too Sothern and too much sorority culture? Far from the beach. 



UCSB Pros:

Well ranked. On the beach/fun. People seem to like it there. Cute campus, very cute town. Live in a beach house. Possibly staying in CA after graduation.

Cons:

Price. No international business (but i think i could make it work). Town too small? No sports.

Originally, I wanted to pursue computer science. I think the idea of creating AI/Machine Learning Algorithms and models is very very fascinating. However, most kids just end up in SWE. Although its a lucrative career path, it doesn't seem as mentally stimulating as other jobs- from what I see, you aren't truly innovating or dealing with unknowns/uncertainty, which makes a job far more appealing to me.   
The other career path I'm considering is Quantitative Finance. The field seems really interesting to me, but its niche and I want to keep my options open. 

Georgia Tech is out of state, I have less familiarity with the school, however the ISyE degree seems to be very versatile. Starting salary of 82k, and you graduate with an engineering degree from a pretty well respected school. 

UIUC is in state, I'm quite familar with the school, and the CS + Econ degree isn't horrible in terms of difficulty. Starting salary of \~120-130k, BUT you graduate with a degree from the school's college of Literature Science and Arts. Not quite sure why since you take the Grainger CS courses, but I'm not sure how this changes the credibility of the degree. 

From what I've gathered, going down the AI/ML or Quant route requires a Graduate degree (correct me if I'm mistaken) so is this a big decision to make? Which school would be stronger for what?

These three schools are my top choices right now and I’m having some difficulty deciding which one to commit to for next year. So let me give some characteristics of each school.

Purdue:
Purdue has a top engineering school with first years having combined courses. It’s on the cheaper side of OOS prices being at 46k with room and board. While its rankings are high some other schools are higher.

UIUC:
UIUC offers a great engineering school as well with Grainger. But I’m OOS hear as well so I would be dishing out 60k+ per year. But UIUC has one of the best MechE programs offered.

UMN: 
The University of Minnesota is my In State school and it has a decent engineering program while also being affordable. I was given a small scholarship as well so this would make it easier to pay for being around 33k. But the programs offered here aren’t necessarily the best est compare to the other two.

Please help me choose and give me advice!!

- idk what gender u are but DTech is the MOST amazing resource, if ur a woman in tech they can help w funding for housing and finding other duke girls in ur summer internship region!! i have a late 
 internship offer in CA and im not from the west coast so thats kind of hard, but i’m already being coordinated w housing options through that :))
- definitely nice variety of CS courses from what i can tell; will say i only took two classes this past year, and one of them (elective) wasnt great but it at least is probably going to be an easy A and i did learn from it. the fundamental courses tho are excellent. owen astrachan is the loml
- duke also has grade inflation (check latin honors cutoffs)
- durham is a fine city! nothing stand out. personally, i find it cute, but i’m also an NC native from a town very similar to it. it has a lot of veryyy good restaurants tho (i have a list that i have been checking off this year and i still have several places remaining… and only two weeks to go…). i do agree tho that its nowhere near as exciting as boston, but there is very little time to go off campus anyway imo when ur busy w classes, clubs, jobs, etc., so i honestly wouldnt let that sway you too much unless u know u plan on spending lots of time off campus and in the city
- food is in fact amazing (but im afraid i already take it for granted)
- greek life does have a strong presence on campus, but it’s very easy to have a good social life outside of it too (especially via SLGs or other clubs! club sports and dance groups are especially great for socializing), and even if ur not in it, u can still make it to parties — its just a little harder than it would be otherwise. i say all this is as someone who initially joined a sorority and dropped bc i realized it wasnt for me lol

overall i wouldnt say CS @ Duke is bad if thats ur main concern! im interning at apple this summer even tho its my freshman year, and i know an oddly high amt of other freshmen also w/ FAANG opportunities, and plentyyy of upperclassmen doing very very well. and even if ur still worried, look into code+ — its a cool program duke offers that lets u get a handson experience over the summer. duke also does pretty well w quant from what i can tell, and that’s something i’m trying to explore myself

overall i literally could not see myself anywhere else. i love love love duke.

I've heard about there being a cap on CCC units that would make someone be considered a transfer student, would this stop me from being considered a senior level transfer due to having less than 90 credits at USD or no? Unfortunately, I have taken some upper-division courses at USD, 25 units in total.

If this can't work out due to the credits alone, it seems like I'd have to drop 3 units of USD classes before the end of the semester, and I would have to personally ask for this as I'm past the drop deadline.",2024-04-23 00:10:40

Target offers a program where they’ll pay for your tuition to go to a select number of schools. My family can’t afford to pay for college and I was never able to get a scholarship. But, my dream is to become a doctor (radiologist). So, I found a school on the list that interested me. The school Excelsior University offers an associates degree in health sciences, what I would like to do is to be able to complete an associate’s degree and then transfer after those 2 years to the University of Illinois, by that point I feel I will have a larger amount of money as during this time I will be working and living at home for the time being. Anyway, I’m wondering if this would be a problem in any way. Such as: will I have a lesser chance of being accepted to transfer since it’s an online school, will I not get the same experience and knowledge vs if I completed my schooling in person, and could this effect my chances of getting into medical school despite if my performance is exceptional, and Is this degree an okay choice and will I still be able to have the same knowledge and accreditment to go down the path I want. I did check and the school is accredited. I appreciate any advice or support.

Only major school I've ever heard of getting blacklisted is Waterloo back in the early 2000's when they accidentally pumped out grads that were too smart work with others and had no life skills. Of which that era has long since passed, and I have yet to hear of a major Canadian school who's currently blacklisted in any industry as of right now, or that doesn't currently hold a good reputation.

Optional Co-ops can sometimes be better on account that if you don't get a Co-op prior to the end of a semester, you're not left scrambling to try and find one to comply with the university's requirements. Rather you are free to find one on your own time, and are still free to graduate in the event that you don't end up getting one. Mandatory Co-ops have sometimes forced people to accept less than ideal internships just to meet with requirements, so I'd advise for a school that advertises optional.

She then goes on to say that GPA is the only thing that matters to admissions and that kids should not do ECs because they can just lie about them and schools won’t check. She says that kids can have fun or get into a good school but not both.

I got an offer for Waterloo CS and UIUC CE, and I'm having trouble deciding on where to go. I also don't know which major to pursue. For some context, I want to work in the states after graduation. 

  
**CS:**

Pros:  
- Can't transfer to CS in basically every school  
- Easier courseload than CE  
- Very versatile in terms of course selection. I can take hardware classes if I wanted

Cons:  
- Might be oversaturated and overly competitive in the future

**CE**:

Pros:  
- I can do both hardware and software  
- More versatile than CS in terms of career paths

Cons:  
- Might not be as good with software as CS students and not as good with hardware as EE students

**UIUC**:

Pros:  
- It's in the states  
- Amazing campus  
- Ranked very high in CE  
- Amazing research opportunities

Cons:  
- Further from home  
- Expensive tuition

**Waterloo**:

Pros:  
- 1st in Canada for CS  
- Co-op, which forces you to grind internships  
- Closer to home  
- Cheaper + some scholarships (it's around 100k cheaper all 4 years combined)  
- Ik some people there already

Cons:  
- Not in the states  
- Campus is worse than UIUC  
- Graduate a year later, since waterloo co-op takes 5 years

2155,t3_1cax845,1713851967.0,"EDIT: Thank you all for commenting! I appreciate everyone's perspective. After reading every comment and reflecting on myself and my values, I think I'll be happiest and grow the most at Duke—the values and the public policy program there really speak to me. Time to learn about basketball, I guess! 

Hello lovely people! I am very lucky to have received a lot of good news this college application cycle, and I have narrowed down my final college choice to either Columbia or Duke. I would really appreciate your help making the final commitment. I'm aware that they have very different vibes, but both gave me a good ""gut feeling"" when I visited so I think it's time to ask for advice from you all.

Some basic info:

* both would be about the same cost to attend
* I'm from a suburb full of old people so I would really like to be somewhere with a bit more bustle and sense of community with people my age
* Intended major: I applied as a **classics major** and would like to study that along with some combo of **public policy/IR** on the pre-law track. Any input about which would be a better fit for me, based on all this, is much appreciated!

**Columbia**

Pros:

* It's in New York City! How magical. I stayed with my cousins in NYC over the summer for about a month and loved the ease and freedom to explore, get cute coffees, see museums, and all that.
   * I lowkey love using the metro.
   * So many opportunities, of course. Many employers are in the city and/or looking to recruit from the city. Even though my future is not on Wall Street, I know there are plenty law/political offices or even museums I could work at. A friend of a friend going here, also a classics major, was a research assistant for Hadestown the Musical (so cool!).
* I got into this undergraduate scholars program (CUSP) that seems like it has really good academic advising and a cool speaker series. It seems hard to pass up the special attention.
* The Core!! As a Latin nerd that can trace a lot of ancient Mediterranean history to Western political thought, I eat up this liberal arts/humanities foundational education stuff.
* Beautiful campus. Feels old and grand. I think just being on campus makes me feel 10 times cooler.
* Classics department has a slight edge over Duke's (a few more resources, a few cool contests)
* Ivy League lol

Cons:

* I'm prone to burnout, and Columbia seems (from the students I've talked to) like it can be stressful. Though I hear that humanities classes aren't graded on a curve, thankfully - can anyone fact check this?
* Cutthroat/hustle culture?
* Cold and gray weather :( I'm from California and my weak body at the moment can't handle anything lower than the 40s.
* Poli sci is a very big major here, so might be more impersonal/harder to bond with professors

**Duke**

Pros:

* Amazing public policy program and opportunities—I'm worried that with it being a big and popular major, competition for internships and all will be stiff, but a current student assured me that's not the case and there is an opportunity to be found for everyone
   * Duke in DC program - get to study and work in DC
* Some really cool faculty I'd like to talk to
* I love the service-oriented approach (""knowledge in service to humanity"") and all that. DukeEngage, etc. - giving back is very normalized there, and it feels very noble and in line with my values. I would definitely take advantage of the service-oriented courses and summer opportunities if I came here.
* Seems like it's really easy to build community—the freshman dorms have huge common spaces, the dining halls have long tables for big groups to eat at, etc. I care about community because I haven't had a lot of that thus far.
* People really seemed happy here when I was visiting. Everyone was so kind and willing to talk to me about their experience/show me around.
* Other more superficial stuff: loved the beautiful campus, great food, also the warm weather is so nice

Cons:

* Durham isn't as big a city as New York, of course. But I'm not sure if it's harder to find work/internships in Durham, NC than in NYC, given people probably recruit from Duke?
* It is an athletic/sporty school to some extent, and I am a couch potato/not really a sports fan (open to becoming one, though!). I'm not really sure if I could get into the whole tenting culture.
* Arguably not as much name-brand recognition as Columbia (I mean outside of the US - I'm considering working or studying abroad in the future).",2024-04-23 01:59:27

From what I've read up on, typically additional information and updates should be paired with the LOCI, but Georgetown's seems to be a bit different?

The downside, however, is that I just learned I can only do one, as CPS and LEDA are very similar programs. As a very clueless student, I have no clue which to pick, and some advice would be greatly appreciated. Here's some pros and cons off the top of my head:

LEDA  
pros:

* all expenses paid summer camp at Princeton or Yale (very very exciting)
* does... something? stuff?

cons:

* haven't done interview yet =&gt; might not get in
* extremely unclear what exactly the program accomplishes
* cannot do QB

QuestBridge College Prep Scholar:  
pros:

* already accepted
* 6x more likely to get into National College Match
* college admissions conference at Rice
* does something I think

cons:

* also very unclear what the program does
* admissions conference is short, not paid for (gas and hotel is very expensive), and is not particularly exciting

2214,t1_l0v06j8,1713860044.0,"You sound just like me. I could probably predict what your comments say too because I posted here saying the same thing. 

When I made my post I was angry. I watched people who I went to school with who were failing half of their classes, no extracurriculars, people who would skip school to party and never tried in their whole academic career receive scholarships, iPads, and MacBooks to attend their top choice schools. I worked my ass off. I was so tired from studying that I would wake up on my textbooks. The worst part is I let my anger determine my self worth.

I was crying everyday wondering how I did everything right yet it all went wrong. I was waitlisted my top 2, my backup didn’t even put me in my major, and my others were either too expensive or too far from where I had imagined being. Now, my only choice is to go to a local school and transfer. I was above the statistical average of the population that went to where I wanted, yet here I am.

I know that was a lot to unpack, but what I am trying to say is that you are allowed to feel hurt. You are allowed to cry and want more for yourself. People will always try to make you feel like it’s not big deal when it’s not their dreams on the line. I wish I could give you the cure to your problems but I came here to find my solution too. 
The best thing you can do for yourself right now is to breathe and look at what’s in front of you. Right now it may suck but try to find opposites in your routine. If you stay in bed all day take a walk and breathe. If you’re always alone spend some time with friends. The moment you get out of the hopeless mindset you start to change your perspective to find solutions.

What I did was join an art summit that forced me to spend the next few days out of the house to appreciate nature and the value of art. I especially forced myself to do it alone to find clarity in solitude. The noise of thinking of everyone else is what kept me cooped up so I want to spend this time alone only thinking about me. 

I know you may not end up reading all I have to say, so remember this, right now put yourself first. You sound exhausted and you need to focus on putting yourself first in other ways than academics. Everything takes time and maybe one day you’ll turn around and say “I’m so glad this worked out like this for me”. Don’t look at your closed doors, look at your open ones and you will find yourself at peace with where you are. I love the saying “you can be as sweet as a peach, but not everyone likes peaches” because I know that I worked hard, but maybe the college admissions were looking for something more unique than me. And I’m okay with that. 

To conclude this, I want to say don’t let this break your spirit, you will need this drive in college and it will keep you above the rest. Look at the future you want, and think of the the school as the vehicle that will take you there. Make memories right now and remember that you are worth it to keep fighting for what you want. And look at the bright side, you could be walking down the path that was truly meant to find you. :)",2024-04-23 04:14:04

UCLA without a question. In-state California and you have the opportunity to go to UCLA for $15K vs Brown for $70K tuition?!! That's an easy one!

Just a few thoughts on your pros and cons. UCLA doesn't get too hot, its close to the ocean and you're not there in the summer anyways. There's also not much grade deflation at all at UCLA. Re Brown having a more friendly environment, UCLA is very friendly - that should be a pro for both.

UCLA is in LA. I'm not a Southern California type of person, but I've loved exploring LA for these few years - the museums, the beaches, the hiking, the red carpet movie premiers right at our doorstep in Westwood - incredible fun (and likely more fun than Providence). UCLA also has terrific fun sports culture - football, basketball, etc.

Even if costs were the same, I'd choose UCLA hands down. Now you have to pay $55K more per year to go to Providence RI? That's nuts! I'd only consider that for HSM (maybe HYPSM), and Brown is definitely not HYPSM.

Only you know your families financials well enough to know whether $55K a year is a big deal or not. I'd personally say unless you're extremely rich, I'd go to UCLA and take the $55K per year and invest it in the stock market - and you'd have yourself a nice graduation present in four years.

(I wasn’t sure if I wanted to post this at first, but after seeing some posts on this thread, I thought this could be a reminder that getting into your dream school won’t always solve all the problems in your life)

I’m an international student who’s been dreaming of coming to the US for university for years. I pursued my interests, won some competitions, and led what I believe to be a fulfilling academic life in high school. 

However, at the beginning of this school year, when I started working on my applications and my essays, I was in one of the worst points of my life mentally. Unhealthy environment at home (my parents constantly arguing), I lost touch with some of my closest friends, too much pressure I put on myself to do well at school (doing the ib diploma didn’t help the situation). Nevertheless, I pushed through because I couldn’t let all of my work go to waste, and I reassured myself that once I get into my dream school, I’ll finally be able to feel happy again.

Also, my mom was supportive of me. She’s always been the person closest to me, and I also wanted to get into a good school to show her that she raised me well.

March 14th, I open an acceptance letter from MIT. Truly one of my happiest moments, it made me feel like suddenly, all of my problems have been solved. My mom was happy for me too.

Four days later, I come home from school to find my mom wearing a very serious expression. She was at the hospital, she says. She got results from some of the tests she had done. Pancreatic cancer. She realistically has a couple of months left. 

And so I realise that if I go pursue my dreams, I won’t be there with her in her last moments. She won’t see me graduate, she won’t see me build a career or a family. I have two smaller brothers, who will lose their mom and kinda lose their sister from their lives.

Now, going to MIT doesn’t feel like a dream come true, and instead a burden, something very selfish, and something that took my mom away from me (that’s a very irrational thought, but it sure feels that way).

The Bay Area has a lot of people with east asian ethnicity so there shouldn't be problems.

I'll be quite blunt. In the US, there isn't really good vegan food.

That said, there's plenty of vegans and vegetarian options in the Bay Area (more than basically anywhere else). But the options really boil down to mediterranean hummus, salad, vegan burritos, and/or indian curry outdoors. It's something a lot of my friends later on had to adapt by being vegan minus eggs and so forth. Protein is always a challenge for vegans.

There are Korean communities but I don't know much to comment on. I generally recommend, if possible, trying to adapt to the community at the school at large. 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do' might be quite helpful in the longer run.",2024-04-23 05:34:32

Im currently split between two choices. My dream is to go to UF under the Animal Sciences major and become a veterinarian. Unfortunately I didn't get accepted for the fall of 2024 however, I was accepted to UF online and Santa Fe Honors and just need some advice on what I should do next.   


 I want to know if one is better than the other in regards of transferring. I will be moving to Gainesville this summer so I am not really considering going anywhere else.   


 Ive read that going to a CC is a lot better because universities have to accept students from them but does that make transferring from UF online harder? or is it just less conventional. I currently have 100% Bright Futures (full tuition at any FL public school) so I wouldn't have to pay for the ""Optional Fee Package"" which allows me to use all of the UF amenities which is very nice because I can do anything another student can do just without having in person classes but at the end of the day my main concern is transferring that is what i want to do. I want the best chance to be an in person student at UF and tbh I am a little worried taking online classes because I didn't have a good experience during COVID. My counselor is telling me to just go to UF online and that Ill have a lot better chances but what im reading on most posts is the opposite so I would just like someone to clear the air.    


Any advice or information about SF Honors and UF online would be very helpful. THANK YOU   


\- for example, would i be able to get a job at UF as an online student, and have access to the same opportunities. Santa Fe honors has already sent me a lot of information about internships and volunteering opportunities which would be great for my goal of being a Vet.     


(I was also considering taking a GAP year, I had a lot of problems in my freshman year which caused a low gpa, but i retook those classes and with help of ADHD medication i have a 33 on act now which i didnt have at the time of applying)

First, exploring and having fun in the city often requires more money than college town living.  While opportunities for free fun also exist, if your friend groups are opting for costlier pursuits than you can afford, you may feel left out or overextended financially.  Second, certain kinds of city fun are limited to the over-21 set.  While fake IDs are a thing, so are establishments that are very protective of their liquor licenses that simply won’t let you in if you look questionable.  Third, high school students sometimes put a bit too much weight on location.  Typically, the college campus is your primary city and most of your fun will take place there: club gatherings, student performances, restaurant runs, game nights, watch parties, athletic events, campus speakers, etc.  And if I have your location right, you are only 34 miles out of Boston.

I would put UIUC second just because it is really good for Quant but otherwise its pretty similar to the other schools. UWash Seattle's location alone is really good since Seattle is a large tech hub but again there isn't that much difference compared to other schools. Georgia Tech is higher just because you can still switch to CS somewhat easily compared to most other schools where it isn't possible and Georgia Tech has a separate college of computing. UMich is great too and they're building a new building for CS and are expanding on North Campus and its a pretty well known school overall. UT Austin is another great school and Austin is a great location for Tech. UCLA and UCSD are pretty much equivalent but on the undergrad level I'd give the slight edge to UCLA just because of overall prestige but both are excellent and I absolutely love La Jolla.

On the other hand, UCSB seems like a vibey school with an amazing beach and great social scene (which is very important for me, \[not parties/alcohol per se, but active, happy, people\]) I have a friend at Swarthmore who is a bit disgruntled with the social scene which is pretty disconcerting, but I would feel quite foolish turning down the opportunity to go to Swarthmore for the above-mentioned reasons... 

Thoughts?

(A third possibility lowkey exists, I could take a gap year (was leaning towards doing so anyways) and re-apply to some of my dream schools (for additional context, I am currently sitting on the Yale, Northwestern, and UCLA waitlists \[Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Pomona rejected me\]))

Given the above information, do you guys have any advice? I want to stress that I feel very fortunate to be in this ""pickle"" but with the decision deadline approaching, I wanted to get your insight. 

Thank you!!",2024-04-23 09:15:21

2309,t1_l0vvko7,1713878232.0,"I've always lived in mid-sized cities, but, as I think about it, I'm not sure I'd really miss much by living in a small college town.  A city gets you a wider variety of restaurants, maybe some high-end restaurants, maybe pro sports, maybe a wider variety of nightclubs, some museums, maybe a symphony or ballet company, maybe an international airport, maybe some high-end shopping, traveling shows (concerts).

How often do you actually take advantage of those things?  For me, the answer is ""not often"".  My guess is that I could have done 95% of what I did in college (for fun) in a much smaller city, so long as there are a few restaurants I like, a movie theater and a couple bars/clubs.

Specifically with regard to Massachusetts, as others have said, the natural setting is beautiful, you're very close to other more ""rustic"" natural beauty (which you should take advantage of), and you're within a half-day's drive of a number of big cities.",2024-04-23 09:17:12
2310,t1_l0vvoyj,1713878280.0,"Since no one seems to be commenting on the OP's stats, I'll stoke their ego and add my two cents.

Let's be honest, there are not many people that will attain ""higher/better"" metrics than OP...top 1 (academic rigor and grades), perfect ACT (less than 0.5% test takers), etc.. From what I infer based upon the OP, it is not that someone with ""higher/better/more"" credentials got in, it's that someone with what is believed to be ""lesser than"" credentials got in instead. And the sense that what was the point of it all. Coulda/shoulda just did less and not work as hard and still end up where I am. Why bother??...

With the nebulous holistic review process, the reality is this does occur quite often as seen in many other posts. The consequence is that this will eventually discourage the students from excelling and pushing themselves so hard. (Maybe this is good or bad. You can decide for yourself.) This experience will most likely be passed on by the OP to others.

FWIW, I do agree with most of the responses of support for OP and that great things are still attainable. However, as studies have shown, going to the ""elite"" schools (Ivy's for sure) provide a significant boost to future job prospects and earnings potential. That is why people want to go there.  Obviously, nothing is guaranteed, but going to the elite schools help slide the scale more to your favor.

The purpose of having academically elite schools is to have academically elite people studying there. Elite schools aren't going to maintain their status if the academically elite students aren't there. Elite should mean elite. There should be minimum academic requirements that everyone looking to attend needs to meet. Everything else should only be used as a tie-breaker.

The academics particularly for what u want to study are better at cornell and it is certainly more recognized for those fields. Also to clarify cornell does not have grade deflation. It also does not have massive seeder classes like ucla meant on decreasing the class size by half. also ngl you’re never going to have a ton of time to venture deep into la or whatever city you’re in because of your studies. I have many friends at ucla and other city schools who always say they only end up going a couple of times. So, imo, the fact that everything is concentrated on or around campus for cornell adds a lot to the culture and environment. not to mention la is ridiculously expensive to do stuff in anyway. as for school spirit, for an ivy is pretty dang good, but compared to ucla it’s just sad. And tho the weather is cloudy for many months in between fall and spring, everyone seems to overlook that those are the months where it’s supposed to be cloudy on the east coast, and it’s sunny and nice many days as well. You get a full four season experience which means months of sun and warmth with fall and winter and spring in between. Also cornell’s food is better, and u don’t have to wait 15 hours standing in line. I have tried ucla food many times and my friends who go to ucla have visited me and admitted this as well. Lastly, cornell’s student to faculty ratio is much less than that of ucla.

2377,t1_l0w8rfy,1713883182.0,"A six-figure salary that doesn't require certification or further education beyond a bachelor's degree is unlikely.  If you're open to further education beyond bachelor's degree, here are some suggestions courtesy of Chat GPT:

Psychology: Since you're interested in human emotions, psychology could be a fulfilling choice. This field offers various specialties such as clinical psychology, organizational psychology, or sports psychology. With further qualifications, psychologists can earn a substantial income, especially in clinical or private practice settings.

Environmental Science: If you love being outdoors and are concerned about the environment, this could be a great fit. Careers in this field can be both rewarding and impactful, involving work in conservation, environmental consulting, and sustainability. These roles often offer a good balance of office and field work.

Veterinary Science: Combining your love for animals and science, a degree in veterinary science or a related field like wildlife biology could be ideal. Veterinarians do well financially, especially those who own their practices, but this often requires education beyond a bachelor's degree.

International Studies or Linguistics: These fields cater to your interest in different cultures and languages. Careers could range from diplomatic services to international business roles. These areas can sometimes be competitive but are rewarding for those with a passion for cultural exchange and global issues.

Art Therapy: Blending your interest in art, psychology, and therapy, art therapy uses the creative process to help improve individuals' emotional well-being. This would require a specific certification beyond a bachelor’s degree but can be deeply satisfying and well-compensated in the right settings.

Kinesiology or Exercise Science: If you're interested in exercising and martial arts, studying kinesiology or exercise science could lead to careers in sports therapy, personal training, or wellness consulting. Specializing further can lead to roles like sports psychologist or physiotherapist.

Music Therapy: Since you like playing music and are interested in psychology, music therapy combines both. Music therapists work with diverse groups to promote health and well-being through music. This field requires certification and provides a unique, rewarding career.

Theology or Religious Studies: With your interest in theology and mythology, pursuing a degree in theology or religious studies might be appealing. This could lead to roles in academia, counseling, or community leadership, depending on your other interests and further specialization.",2024-04-23 10:39:42

The main thing holding me back from committing to the t5 is that I'll be paying an obscene (especially when converted to my currency) amount of money. To give you context, the tuition for the t5 school would be 10 times the tuition of the one in my country and this school is already considered  expensive in comparison to other local colleges (I would estimate that most colleges in my nation would be half the price of the top one). I was fortunate enough to obtain a selective merit scholarship that covers the total cost of my entire stay to this school. The school would even give me an annual allowance and would also cover other miscellaneous costs like paying for my dorm or off-campus housing (they'll even let me choose) if I decide to attend. 

If I attend the t5, on the other hand, my parents will be fully paying since I'll be receiving no aid. I already talked about this with them and they are willing to pay the full price if I truly want to study there (although they are hesitant about the safety and just the general living experience in the US and the fact that I'll be extremely far away from home so I've been getting the vibe that they want me to take the full ride for convenience and proximity). I feel like I'll grow the most and find the most fulfillment if I study in the US. The opportunities I'll have access to there will also be extremely valuable in the career I want to pursue. However, I am aware that the job market is tough right now especially for international students and I'm concerned that I won't be able to land a job after college and that my degree would be nothing more than an expensive piece of paper that is really just a liability. 

So is it worth it to pursue university in the US despite the circumstances or should I stick to the comfort and convenience that the full ride would give me?

**UT Austin**

UT Pros:

* In state (3 hour bus ride)
* Lively college culture and campus - I know I'll enjoy it
* Austin as a city is really nice
* My sister and lots of friends are going there
* Good balance between academic and social life
* CS coursework isn't incredibly difficult and manageable
* Freshman Research Intiative guarantees research exposure in interested areas (Big Data in Biology)

UT Cons:

* Normal CS student (no honors)
* Harder to make new friends because a lot of in-state students come with their existing friends
* Can get lost in party culture + having fun if not focused
* 4+1 fastrack, and it's hard to get into

**Georgia Tech**

GT Pros:

* Received Gold Scholarship that cuts price down to in-state cost
* Access to unique resources, faculty members, and community through Gold Scholarship
* Slightly ranked higher than UT
* More motivated student body that leads to more diverse career outlooks in entreprenuership
* Priority housing 
* 3+1 fastrack, easy to do
* Basically guaranteed to get T&amp;M program to receive minor in Computing &amp; Business because of scholarship status (heard really good things about the program in terms of opportunities)
* CS degree is more flexible due to the Threads Program

GT Cons:

* The ""nerd"" stereotype and how people are always in the books
* Not a dealbreaker but out of state (2.5 hour flight)
* College is notorious for being difficult
* Atlanta can be a little dangerous

In general, I think that research opportunities and clubs/organizations are relatively the same. Even though their rankings are so similar, I wonder if I'll end up in a different spot post-graduation if I choose one over the other because of any slight differences in recruiting, the more opportunities I can get at GT (at least that's what it looks like), or the possibility that I engage in the start up scene at GT. 

  
Is it selfish of me to still be considering UT? I feel like everything career and academic oriented favors GT, but I know I'd love UT's environment and fit in well. But if I can also fit in at GT, then it shouldn't be something I should be considering right?

But it also works the other way around. If I get end up at the same place post-graduation, then why wouldn't I go to UT and have a basically guaranteed memorable college experience?

Intended Major: Chemistry, particularly inorganic (plan to go to grad sch after college)

Cost: Full pay (Intl)


Academics (Quarter vs Sememster)
I'm honestly fine with both, although I understand the quarter system at NU is gonna be faster paced than the semester system schools.

Since I'm planning on grad sch I'm kinda worried about grade deflation (cough Cornell) and I heard chemistry is especially brutal (i mean it's brutal at most places) at Cornell (another great look for CHEM). NU and Duke seem a lil less stressful and have grade inflation / no deflation.

Duke seems to have the best undergraduate teaching though, so i'm mixed.

Academics (Research)
All are great in terms of undergraduate research opportunities and accessibility but differ in focus. Duke slightly lags behind in terms of research output in my major because most of it is biomedical related, and I'm lie on the more physical side. NU on the other hand has an excellent department overall (esp inorg) and an extremely strong materials science faculty. No clue about Cornell - seems pretty strong overall.

Campus

American campuses are so pretty!! Especially in love with Cornell's architecture, slope and waterfalls. Downtown Ithaca is also pretty neat. NU's lake comes a close second and I like Evanston's small suburb feel. Duke's architecture is gothic and the forest is decent I guess?

Chicago is my favourite US city by far, and I love love love the L. So idk maybe that will sway it a bit? Ithaca has good vibes but I'm afraid it will get to small. 

Climate
I may be weird but cold &gt;&gt; hot - so Ithaca and Evanston are nice places (wind and snow yay). Durham was too hot I cannot take hot humid summers anymore.

Programs
There's ISP at NU which is apparently really great for research and academic rigor for grad sch. Haven't got into any other programs at the other institutions (e.g. FOCUS)

Admitted Students Day
Ngl it felt like NU and Duke put in a lot more effort than Cornell which was not the most organized I shall say.

There's definitely something a little off  or strange about it (have you looked at their Facebook page?). In an age of smaller private colleges and universities closing down for low enrollment, I would be wary. You would be better off getting affordable education from a local public community college that would be more stable and trustworthy (and then transferring for a four-year degree if you want to - just make sure you're on the transfer path at the CC and not taking random classes!). I mean, I don't think a degree from here would be the worst thing in the world though, I guess, since it does have a regional accreditation.",2024-04-23 12:42:53

I'm currently facing a dilemma about switching colleges and could use some advice. I've been studying Management and Finance as double majors, but I'm considering a switch to a STEM field—specifically Psychology and Biology, which really interest me but I dont want to waste these 2 year in the trash

The college I want to switch to accept 12 out of my 47 credits of my business degree, essentially meaning I'd be starting over as a freshman. My counselor advised me to stay and complete my double majors, but the next term will be fully online, which diminishes my college experience and I do NERVER want to do online classes again.

I have four years of FAFSA eligibility remaining, and I'm two years away from completing my current business degree.

I plan to switch  and start the new degree in STEM. To finance the remaining two years of my business degree, I would rely on external scholarships or take out a loan. Additionally, I'm considering enlisting in the military to pursue my M.S. and also plan to delay my graduation to preserve FAFSA eligibility for the STEM degree.

Complicating matters, my parents do not support my decision to transfer and prefer that I stay home with them, they also want me to finish college fast, but I dont want to face loneliness or be miserable after college.

is it possible ?

PS: i would be taking all online for the finance one",2024-04-23 12:56:24

International student here. I got into all three in US

My intended major is Molecular Biology/Biochemistry/ Biomedical Engineering/Biotechnology and then I wanna do Masters/PhD to work in Biotech research. I got waitlested from Colby, Tufts, and Emory. If I got off the waitlist for Tufts I will be committing to there but as for now where do you think I should commit?

UMiami:

*Premier Scholarship+$$$ (almost full ride)

*Foote Fellows Honors Program

*PRISM Program (Advanced Program for Integrated Science and Maths)

*Foote fellow allows u to do a lot majors and minors and good courses and research interests in faculty for my major

*Weather and Miami

*Cousin lives in Boca Raton (1 hour drive)

URichmond:

*Richmond Scholar (full ride)

*Small school

*Good programs and only college with leadership major

*Not much professors with same research interest with me 

*Close to major cities at East Cost

UNC Chapel Hill:

*Didn’t get the scholarship but I will try to fond sponsor from my country

*One of the best public schools in the US

*Good courses and programs for my major

*Love Duke&amp;UNC joint opprtunities

*Good study abroad programs

University of Toronto:

*International Scholar in both Mississauga and Scarborough campuses(180.000$ for for years + 15k first year for both and 12k more for four years in Mississauga)

*Still expensive tho with housing and food 

*One of the best for biotechnology and life sciences t20 in the world

*A lot of major biotech companies in Toronto so good job and internship opportunities 

I also applied to UK and got into University of Bristol, still waiting for Edinburgh, and Warwick. 

I probably wouldn’t go to Colby over these schools but I love Tufts and Emory. In love with Tufts majors and programs and Emory is has good  programs as well. Will wait for the waitlist results.

(based on families with assets less than $150,000, residing in the United States with one child enrolled in college. And Princeton does not take include retirement account and primary residence for net worth calculation unlike most other schools)

|Income|Total cost of attendance (any external scholarship is added in so result is same)|
|:-|:-|
|$75,000|$0|
|$100,000|$0|
|$150,000|$12,500|
|$200,000|$25,000|
|$250,000|$37,500|
|$300,000|$50,000|

It's the number 1 school in the US for a reason. It also has $34.2 billion in endowment and most $ per student. It will help fund whatever study abroad you want on top because it's a school well known to focus on undergrads (which is highly unusual for a research university).

It's also ridiculously difficult to get into. So there's that. Also, it's the #1 school in which most alumni donate after college so it's clearly doing something right at 46% of average alumni donating (schools like U of Houston-Clear Lake is 0.12% in comparison): [link](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/colleges-where-the-most-alumni-donate)

I know 2 peers who graduated from Princeton. 1 got a MBA at Wharton afterwards and works as an equity research analyst at a hedge fund. The other works at Google.

I can see the strategy though-- cherrypick your best bets for yield, reject the ones that are at the bottom of your pile, waitlist the rest, and only pick off people you feel really confident about accepting if you need them. Those who didn't bother to do the LOCI sort of thing on the waitlist response form get weeded right out.

Except that there are 900,000 graduates from no name schools and 10,000 graduates from top 5 schools, so the conditional probability of getting a prestigious job with a top 5 school degree is 100 / 10000 compared to 900 / 900000, or 10x higher.

Cons: An LAC might not set me up for a job the same way RIT can, could be harder to gain experience + internships

2574,t1_l0xh2bk,1713898144.0,"UCLA had a 0.8% admit rate for their BSN Nursing program for 2023.  I would not set my sights on UCLA as a goal but there are plenty of schools where you can get a Nursing degree.  

As a HS Freshman, you want to meet your HS graduation requirements along with the UC/Cal State a-g course requirements listed below.  Since you are in a California HS, your HS curriculum should follow the UC/CSU guidelines. 

[UC A-G course requirements](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/subject-requirement-a-g.html)

If you want a direct admit into a BSN program, then you need top grades and to exceed the minimum listed requirements especially in Math/Science courses. 

There are only 2 UC’s that offer a BSN program as a direct admit for Freshman college students: UCLA and UCI.  As stated, UCLA had a less than 1% admit rate and UCI was a 1.2% admit rate. 

There are 3 Cal states that offer a direct admit BSN program: San Diego State, Cal State Fullerton and San Marcos.  Again, these are highly competitive and their acceptance rates are around 5% or less. 

Many other Cal states offer a Pre-Nursing program where you are admitted as a Freshman, you take the Nursing pre-requisite courses and then apply to the Nursing school at the end of Sophomore year.  As a Pre-Nursing student at any of these CSU’s, there is no guarantee you will be admitted to that particular Nursing school so you would need to apply to a wide range of schools at the end of Sophomore year.  These are considered 2+2 schools. 

Here is a link of the CSU’s that offer the Pre-Nursing majors: https://www.calstate.edu/attend/degrees-certificates-credentials/Pages/search-degrees-results.aspx?campuses=&amp;k=Nursing%20Pre-Licensure&amp;

This is summary of how to become a Nurse and the different options: 

The easiest and most direct way is to major in nursing as an undergrad the first time around. You'd need to go to a university that offers a BSN (bachelor's of science in nursing) program. These usually take four years, and sometimes take five. There are two flavors of these BSN programs. A small number of schools offer direct admission as a freshman (e.g., you're admitted to the school of nursing when you apply to the college, and you are guaranteed to be a nursing major as long as you keep your grades up). But most make you apply to the nursing school in your sophomore year to start your junior year. In those, you complete pre-nursing prerequisites in your first two years and then start nursing classes in your third year.

The second way is to complete a regular bachelor's degree (in anything, although a science major makes this easier), then go back to school and get an accelerated second BSN. ABSN programs usually take 14-18 months after your first bachelor's degree, which adds time and expense to getting your BSN. This route is usually chosen by people who didn't realize they wanted to be a nurse until after they were already in college, but I've known a couple of college students who chose to go this route because they wanted to go to a liberal arts college to undergrad and yet still wanted to be a nurse. If you do this you have to plan your prerequisites carefully, since colleges without nursing programs tend not to have classes like anatomy and physiology.

The third way is to complete a regular bachelor's degree (in anything, although again, a science major makes this easier) and then go into an entry-to-practice MSN program. Entry-to-practice programs are 3-year programs in which you get your RN in the first year and then your MSN in the last two years, which allows you to practice as a nurse practitioner. This is only a good idea if you know you want to be a nurse practitioner (an NP is a nurse who gives primary care).

Really, if you know you want to be a nurse now, the best way is to go to a college/university that has a nursing undergrad major.

One additional option is to get an Associates degree in nursing from a Community College that has an approved RN program. Those programs are usually competitive for entry, unlike most other community college programs. Often, the community college has a waiting list for nursing and will make you take a number of science classes first to prove that you are capable of handling it, before you are accepted as a nursing major. Your job opportunities will not be as wide as if you have a BSN, but you should still have no problem getting hired. Many of those grads then go onto later get a BSN, while taking classes part-time. Many health care employers will subsidize those classes.",2024-04-23 14:49:04

10. I attended a summer camp program hosted by Trinity College Dublin last summer. For academic rewards, I got a lot of academic awards in my previous school (my new one doesn't offer academic awards on an annual basis). Some awards I received include; 
11. Best in Chemistry: two times. 
12. Best in Biology: two times 
13. Overall best student: two times 
14. Best in Computer Studies: once. If my school offers academic awards on my graduation, I expect to win the best in Biology, Economics, Swahili and Math AA SL. I know this post is already long but above are my stats. I don't think they are great especially since I'm an international student seeking a massive amount of financial aid. So people of Reddit, can you please recommend me some Universities to apply to for next fall? (I prefer the Northeast, Texas and California but I'm not picky). Thank you in advance.

I think the drinking scene at the NESCAC schools is what you make it. If you want to party, you can. If you want to go to parties but not drink, you can. If you want to do loads of other stuff, whether that's arts, outdoors, intellectual pursuits, politics or whatever else, you can. 

The quality of education at Colby is also unbelievable. The differences between the two are really minimal to nothing in real terms - the idea that there's a big difference is a product of US News rankings more than almost any real factor.

After visiting both schools on accepted students day I have reasoned out the pros and cons for each school listed  them below. I am still yet to commit but I just want the opinions of others before I do commit.

UPenn:

Pros: 

- Ranked higher overall

- Closer to home (2 1/2 hours away)

- Better campus vibe

- Better campus location

- Can take classes in Wharton and potentially get a double degree with Wharton

  
Cons:

- Slightly worse CS program

- Internships need to obtained outside of the school (no recruiting like Cornell)

  
Cornell:

Pros:

- Better CS program

- Meinig Family Scholar (leadership program that gives me access to funds for research and internships and gives me a Cornell administrative mentor like the university president which opens up the door to a lot of connections both inside the school and for internships/jobs)

- Internship recruitment (Top tech companies go to Cornell to recruit especially for CS)

- Project Teams (I don't think UPenn has engineering clubs like them)

  
Cons:

- Lower ranked overall

- Further from home (5 hours away)

- Worse campus vibe and location

- More stress and alleged grade deflation

  
While Penn has more pros and less cons, I feel like the pros for Cornell are way better than the pros for UPenn and are definitely enough to outweigh the cons.

2645,t1_l0xv3j9,1713902794.0,"My favorite essay I’ve ever read is one of my family friend’s common app from a couple years ago.

He wrote about spending two summers in Japan. The first summer, he stayed with a host family in Tokyo for 10 weeks and explored the big city/immersed himself the Japanese culture. The following summer, he decided to volunteer at a family farm in Hokkaido, where he did laborious farm tasks. He worked in the fields pretty much all day, and at night he played with the family’s kids. Then, one day, he missed his alarm and woke up at 11 am, realizing the entire family was already out working. He used his broken Japanese to try and apologize in the humblest way to the father, but the father wasn’t mad; instead, he smiled and told him “You are a hard worker, [name]. No need to apologize.” 

The “climax” of the essay was him appreciating the compassion the family showed him. The family has done hard labor for decades, the same labor that broke him down in mere days, yet they were still thankful and kind to him. 

The essay then goes on to talk about how he started a fundraiser a couple years later when Japan was hit with a natural disaster, and how he will never forget the kindness of that family. 

I love the simple yet genuine voice/story this essay conveyed, and I tried really hard to emulate the same in my own essay. It was featured in Harvard Crimson, so you should give it a read if you want: https://www.thecrimson.com/topic/sponsored-successful-harvard-essays-2021/",2024-04-23 16:06:34

* UIUC for $63k/yr
* Purdue for $45k/yr
* Rutgers HC for $17k/yr

Out of UIUC and Purdue, I’m leaning towards Purdue as it is more affordable with similar programs. However, between Purdue and Rutgers HC is difficult as I would be 132k more for a BS degree (I also intend to get an MS or MBA). I have heard that many employers don’t care which university you studied at for engineering, but rather what your skillset is and what work you have done there. I feel that I may have better opportunities at Rutgers HC as I will have priority for internships and research and have a better chance of getting into an elite grad school v.s. trying a lot harder to stand out at Purdue or UIUC as a regular student. For reference, I am in-state for Rutgers and out-of-state for UIUC and Purdue. For these reasons, I am having a hard time justifying paying 132k more for a Purdue degree   
and 183k more for a UIUC degree as I plan to work in the industry after grad school.

2673,t1_l0y1o5v,1713904944.0,"Four of us graduated out of our high school class with a perfect 4.0 unweighted (very, very academically oriented class).

One of them was the daughter of university professors (she went to Brown for American history). I think she was thinking the whole English/Literature route for a bit (completed MA, started PhD and quit) and then decided in her early 30's to pursue a JD. She's an attorney these days.

I forget what M.'s parents were but they were pretty academically oriented.

R., I believe dad was a doctor and mom was a librarian or something like that. Her parents got divorced freshman year, so she had a nervous breakdown and took some time off.

R+M went to the in state flagship public university. They're doing fine for themselves. R is the staff accountant for a charter school (pretty cushy job). M ... did a double major in Economics and Business, went and consulted 3-4 years, eventually went to Harvard Business School, became Managing Partner for group within Investment Banking, and now manages his own capital fund in Silicon Valley.

Shrug. A number of our other classmates are doing fine (some dentists, doctors, attorneys, counselors, business owners like at least 4 that I'm aware of, a naval engineer, one guy is a designer at Cessna, etc.) and the majority went in state. I think out of my class, about 80% finished a Bachelor's degree.

I can point out a lot of lessons that people have learned (since we're over 3 decades out from high school graduation):

\* you only have control over what you do, not over who accepts you

\* you can make the best of opportunities that come your way

\* you don't need others to validate that you're intelligent

\* march to the beat of your own drum

\* everything that has trade offs or has opportunity cost. Sometimes that cost involves sleep, money, time, friendships/relationships, etc.

My younger brother ... I think my parents wanted him to go to a top university, get a marketing/business degree, go the corporate route, but he's always been super-rebellious. He's had a much more interesting life (was an actor and extra, managed at a liquor store, managed ice wine harvests, was a short order chef, was a photographer in college, worked as a bank teller and worked in government savings bonds, etc.) and he did complete an Associates Degree in his mid-30's.

2678,t3_1cbfhko,1713905254.0,"I didn’t get the Gates scholarship. I made it all the way to finalist and I thought my interview went great. But somehow and somewhere I fell short and I can’t understand it. I have done everything I was supposed to do since starting high school and honestly even before then. Because I know how bad I want to be successful. I didn’t have the teenager experience full of boys and a bunch of friends and gossip and parties. I am nothing but a student. And I know I missed out on a lot. But I also come from a broken and dysfunctional home and as a kid I knew I had to make it out of there and get away from my parents if I were going to survive. I knew that doing well in school would be rewarded and so when I left for college I would never have to go back and my mom could never hurt me again. I could build the life for myself that I deserved and I would find love and joy and peace. I have a 4.40, good enough act, I have done every internship I could do, doing everything from biotechnology research to business administration. I ran a small business from the time I was 11 up until I was 18. And not one of those small businesses that never make money, I was making thousands just by selling handmade masks during the pandemic. I am salutatorian of my class (2/250), I poured my heart into the essays, phases and interview for this, and did all the other stuff to try and make myself the perfect candidate. I talked about apps I made to help with the climate crisis, how important school is to me and the one teacher I have who I could rely on like the mother I always wanted. I proved myself over and over again all to not be chosen. You’re telling me I’m gonna have to worry about paying for school after working myself damn near into an early grave in an effort to sure I wouldn’t have to worry abt that? I can’t do it alone and neither can my parents. I just don’t understand. I know I can apply for other scholarships. I know that I’ll get some federal aid. But I don’t want to a million more essays than I already have done. I wanted the scholarship I worked all year toward. I wanted the one that would undoubtedly help me live out college exactly the way I want to and take advantage of every growth opportunity given. I can’t do that if I can’t afford to start the semester. The winners talk about how they wrote their essays an hour before the deadline and after working on mine for weeks I couldn’t get anything? I am not the type to talk about my feelings at all, and especially not to strangers on the internet but I genuinely can’t understand and I don’t know how to move on from this. I don’t want to have to work myself silly for another 4 years trying to do school and work a job. I deserve to have financial security for my college experience. I proved that to them and I have an extensive academic and extracurricular record to show that. What more could I have done? How can I accept this? I just don’t understand. If you’re gonna be unkind please don’t comment. I really need help. I can’t accept this. Everything I did for 4 years straight and everything I sacrificed amounted to nothing. What do I do now? 

Edit 1: seems I’ve run into a few trolls (I thought this sub would be a little more mature than that but wtv) so maybe I got a little off track and ranted a little. I am trying to say that I worked incredibly hard to make myself the best applicant for these types of opportunities, but especially this one, and falling short has me questioning my efforts and worth as a student. It makes it hard to stay motivated because it doesn’t seem like I reaped the reward I was looking for. I understand it is very selective. I understand I am not entitled to anything just because I work hard and “do all the things”. I am looking for advice from others who have gone through similar mental health struggles regarding school and college because this is a new experience for me and because I don’t know how to process it (because I didn’t magically learn how to have the greatest mental health and self esteem known to man when I turned 18) Im hoping someone can give me a bit of advice and support.

Hard work doesn't guarantee you a full ride to college.  Sorry if you thought that was the case.

Given you progressed to the finalist phase for the Gates scholarship, there are likely schools you could apply to that would award you a significant amount of non-need-based (""merit"") aid.  Potentially a full-ride.

Since the Gates scholarship specifically targets low-income households, you might also receive enough financial aid at some schools that you would have to pay almost nothing to attend.

The elimination of the multi-child discount in particular is a real kick in the nuts to many middle class families. In the past you got your financial aid offer when you got your acceptance and could spend time mulling over the pros and cons, including finances. This year, lots of people are still sitting in limbo with no clue what the preferred school will cost, and are going to get some unpleasant surprises when it comes. Those people likely also have more affordable safeties that are starting to look more attractive because they know they can afford them.  Once all the financial aid offers are out,  I think there will be more declines due to financial reasons (and probably overenrollment at state schools as a result).

So now when the AOs go to the waitlist, they are looking for people who don't need financial aid or need less of it. Just about all schools (even those with need-blind admissions) are need-aware when it comes to waitlist, and they've given away the bulk of their institutional funding to their first choices.

We are on some waitlists and have settled on a state school in the meantime. The more we sit with it (and do our best to fall in love with it), the more attractive the state school looks, especially when it's going to cost half as much as the other schools likely would. If we get that call, there are going to be some hard discussions about the tradeoff of going to a preferred school and graduating with loans, and graduating from the state school debt-free. After spending so much time seeing the good side of the school that may have been a less attractive option earlier, it's going to be a lot harder for those waitlist schools to win us over.",2024-04-23 17:18:24

you were a FINALIST. that is a huge accomplishment on its own and one that deserves recognition. and it also means that you have the talents and abilities to go far- both in your education and in ways to fund that. 

i know you were likely looking for this scholarship to be your saving grace when it comes to tuition but there are other options. work studies, jobs, other scholarships (ones you probably already have written essays for and can just fill out forms and apply). there are work arounds. and you have proven yourself to be dedicated and driven enough to achieve great things don’t let this one disappoint be your setback for life.

Just to address this very small point, college work-study jobs are great in my experience.  Many of them give you down time to study or get work done. You actually can also learn skills there that will help you in your future career. True story: one of my work-study jobs was in the Communications &amp; Developments office and my job was to fold press releases and other mailings, stuff them into envelopes, and seal them.  I learned how to do this job super quickly so that I had more down time for my schoolwork. I'd time myself and then try to beat my best time (it was a boring repetitive job, had to make it fun somehow).

I kid you not when I say that the practical skill I have used the most in my life is the ability to fold and stuff envelopes super quickly. Now, these days that's an obsolete skill-- it's like I am telling you I learned how to make buggy whips. But it's just as likely you're going to learn some other really practical skill in your work study job that will help you out in the future.

One of my other WS jobs was working in the mailroom. Learning so many names came in super handy in college reunions and other networking events--  I would see people's name tags and I knew their name and could tell them where their mailbox was. It was a silly party trick but it broke the ice and made those events go much more smoothly.",2024-04-23 17:30:18

UMD
- Much cheaper for me (in state + scholarships)
- 4 year living-learning program in the honors college
- Around 150 students in my major and they say the faculty are good
- I don't love College Park
- Campus is exhausting to navigate
- If I wanted to focus on computer science or engineering, UMD is great at those subjects
- Close to DC so government internships and jobs are convenient

UNC 
- more expensive but doable
- 500 students in my major and the advisors are great
- I love Chapel Hill and everything that's within walking distance from campus
- Opportunity to apply to the school of public health and concentrate in Environmental Health Sciences, which completely aligns with my interests
- I disagree with North Carolina's politics, which worries me because it's a public university
- No engineering, which could feel restrictive if my interests change

Planned ECs:

Summer Internship: I have a couple finance options that I applied to. Another question I have is if you guys think it’s possible to get an investment banking internship as a high schooler? Would it even be worth it if someone answered my cold emails and gave me a shadowing opportunity? I need a big finance EC to help me standout that’s my main issue in my application.

Math competition: I was enrolled in an Olympiad but it got canceled, I’m working with my teacher to find another comp because I feel like it would help display my passion for math.

I feel that my application lacks a BIG EC, so if you guys have any additional ideas for one I’m all ears.

I have interest in finance/ investment banking and I want to go to a school that will provide opportunities for IB.

2785,t3_1cbjj2u,1713915260.0,"Hello I’m deciding between UCDavis and UCSanta Barbara for undergrad pre-law. 

UC Davis: 

Pros:

* Major political science (more in the law field)
* Climbing up the ranks (but I don’t really trust US news ranking)

Cons:

* Good social life but not as good as sb
* 7 hours away from home (longer commute but im dorming so not big of any issue)
* Rural (dont really like the location) Norcal
* Weather
* More students (already a public school)

UC Santa Barbara:

Pros:

* Major Econ and accounting (allows me to venture into business while still doing pre-law)
* Good social life (party school)
* UCSB historically has been higher than Davis
* Lower acceptance rate than Davis
* Location: beach 
* Weather

Cons:

* A lot of distractions (partying)

For both schools tuition would be around the same cuz I live in CA and would get the same amount of financial aid. But I’m trying to be a lawyer (not to sure on the specific still figuring it out if u guys have any input on which school would be best for the type of lawyer that would be great) so it would be my undergrad for law school and I’m also trying to do the two year transfer which I know is super hard cuz they are both public schools with lack of resources. So then based on the pros and cons (I know it seems like im favoring sb but im not I just haven’t done much research into Davis becuz I thought I was going to sb for the longest time but people r saying Davis is just as good), possible internships (opportunities around both areas), and the possibility of a two year transfer what school would u recommend for pre-law undergrad aiming for two year transfer to a private or a better uc (like UCLA or berkley).",2024-04-23 19:34:20

I'm 21 studying English Literature (Bachelor) &amp; I think by next year I'll be done. I only have 3 semester left. I'm thinking to get a scholarship for Master's and which option seems the best so please give some of your opinions, would be so nice thanks.

Plan A : I have to study real hard for a good GPA 3.8 - 3.5 (???) then do some research &amp; anything that can help my resume, if possible I might get a part time job related to my major.

-&gt; So with good GPA I might have chance to get more full-fund scholarships with better pay or at least be the first pick.
* This is very important because some countries require the student to have some start up money but if the scholarship is more then the amount required then you don't need to have that much money.

-&gt; anyways I just know plan A is cheaper &amp; I have more options but the negative side it's that these scholarships are extremely hard to keep afterwards (tho it's worth it) &amp;  I'm NOT 100% sure if I have decided what I want to do with the rest of my life. So having to study till PhD scares me. 

Plan B : With this I thought of not caring about my grades I will only work 24/7 while my grades would be an average or maybe lower. However I can get Netherlands or Italy scholarship which 100% granted.

* BUT there's a big chance here !!! My country has a horrible economy. Right now it will take me 3 years to be able to gather 7000 Euro &amp; it might turn to 4 yeat process if my country economy fail in a couple of months.
-&gt; So my biggest risk with this it's that if they remove the scholarship, I'm afraid my chances will get low because with a low budget and good grades I can at the very least go to China or England but with not enough budget for the certain country &amp; horrible grades I can just cry.",2024-04-23 19:38:47

My sai index is -1500 I believe and I am so so grateful that I received the Morrill scholarship at OSU (full tuition) on top of the Governor's Merit Scholarship (5K) to start with.

Good luck!

Edit: This approach — a focus on grades and campus involvement — also complements your transfer goals.

However, we unfortunately had an income drop (special circumstance) and therefore we reached out to the financial aid counselor to let her know of our circumstances and ask us what could be done.

That person allowed us to submit the CSS profile/FASFA in early spring, we then submitted multiple special circumstances documents/tax returns etc, upon their/WashU's request all showing the income drop that had occurred which would be seen in 2024 bank statements, etc.

However, we recently got an email saying that our appeal had been taken in front of the special circumstances committee and rejected due to the need of more information regarding the 2024 finances. We are extremely confused by this decision due to WashU's commitment to meeting 100% demonstrated need, along with a need-blind process.

Cons: EXPENSIVE, possible lack of opportunity in the area (for ecs and potentially jobs but I could be wrong), I wouldn’t have much money left to put toward dental school

Cons: campus is overwhelmingly large to me, I don’t see myself really fitting in socially (I could be wrong but I can’t find myself relating to ANYONE on the class of 28 page), large lecture halls, I’m not into partying, gen eds (not necessarily bad just in comparison to Rochester it’s a drawback)

Cost: Good fin. aid for both, I pay about 4.3k for the upcoming year

Additonal info: I visited Dartmouth during their fly-in program Dartmouth Bound and was unable to visit Georgetown prior to May 1 due to conflicts. :( or else I think this decision would be easier to make.

**Georgetown**

Pros:

* **D.C.** is a cool city (!!!)
   * proximity to many things, e.g. concerts, shopping, food, museums (I'd like to experience the city during my college years)
* Supposedly **easy access to internships** during the school year
* I like that **GU is in its bubble** but you can still access the city
* Interested in their **Business and Global Affairs major**
* Strong **SFS and MSB programs** (on another note I really like the MSB building)
* I like their whole ""**cura personalis**"" commitment
   * despite me not being Jesuit/Catholic, it seems to me that they're very inclusive and try to be diverse

Cons:

* **Mid-low tier facilities**
   * not great upkeep of facilities either, takes a while to get help if there is any need for fixing. Food is (apparently) mediocre
* **Competitive**, exclusive club (pre professional) culture and could bleed into the student body
   * Also, I heard there are curves at McDonough, conrtibuting to this competitive culture. I don't know if this is a valid concern but it's something that stuck with me.
* Overall I am **unsure of what student life/culture is like**.
   * I tried to get a picture of it through my research to compare to Dartmouth but it's been difficult. I'm  concerned about connecting with others and having a good social life, and I know I'll have it at Dartmouth but I'm not sure about GU (which might sound trivial... but yeah.)

**Dartmouth**

Pros:

* **Flexible** with courses and thru D-Plan
   * will allow me to explore what I like if I end up changing my mind on business
* Apparently (not too sure a friend of mine said this) very **strong for consulting** despite not having a business undergrad
* Appreciate the **tight-knit community** and felt like I was sure to be supported throughout my four years (!!!)
   * Generally nice and collaborative students based off my visit, felt very welcoming and seen
* **Dorms are okay**, I have no complaints really, **food was great** though and set the standard for my expectations
* Ivy league lol (but is not a big deciding factor) 
* **Grade inflation**? Not too sure
* I think GU is still sort of personable as it's not too big but Dartmouth seems like it **guarantees the personable college classes and experience**

Cons:

* Although **Hanover** is beautiful it is small and I don't know how I would like it for four years, my current town is already sort of small and I wanted to branch out for college + it is nature-oriented (which I don't not enjoy but I am not a heavy outdoors person.)
   * If I wanted to go to the city I'd have to go to Boston, which doesn't seem like it would be an often occurrence
* **Greek life** is prevalent as opposed to GU's lack of Greek life, I don't know if I would like it

Overall I really enjoyed my three days at Dartmouth, and it stuck with me ever since, but I feel as if it's unfair to compare as I never got to experience Georgetown IRL and there are a lot of aspects that attract me towards Georgetown. Also, feel free to correct me on anything I've said! Thank you :)",2024-04-23 22:08:04

However, I have this peculiar pattern for other core subjects  
  
- I got a B in Honors Bio (I litterally took it because it was my worst subject in middle school and I wanted to learn more about it). I then got an A in AP Bio and a 5 on the exam  
- I got a C in English in 9th and C+ in 10th. I'm getting an A in AP Lang and probably a 5 on the exam judging from mock exams  
- I had a B- in French grade 9 and C in 10th, but I'm coming back with a B+ in 11th  
- Finally, I'm getting a C this year in Chem, but planning to take an online com. college course an earn an A using what I've learned (Chem 1A = AP Chem)

  
So my GPA isn't spectacular (My UC GPA will probably be around a 4.1, I believe), but I would really like to go to UCLA, UCB, or other great schools that are a bit out of my reach. Of course, my SAT is good (1570 on May) and PSAT (1490), but still (And UC's are test optional)

  
So I'm not really sure what to do here. Will colleges understand what I was doing? Will they care if I state it? Am I cooked for UCs and other good colleges? \[I'm probably applying for Data Sci, Comp Sci, EE, CSE, etc. depending on the school\]. I just want advice on if i need to / how I can emphasize that while I'm not perfect the first time, I try to grind to a better place, but I'm not sure if I can do it against the hundreds of thousands of 4.0s.

For Seton hall, if I commuted it will only be $5000 per year (20k all four yrs) and I got a $87,000 scholarship to cover all four yrs of college. So I’d be paying basically nothing for college. The commute is 30-40 min.

I plan to go pre-med and I’d rather go to FSU because I don’t really have friends from highschool and I think commuting would be depressing but I don’t want to be a big financial burden on my parents.

Honestly, location held the largest sway over where I went by a country mile. 

I wanted to be close to home, where I could leave campus if I absolutely needed to go home, but I also wanted to be far enough away from home to begin cultivating a sense of both responsibility and independence, like “Ok, I’m more or less on my own now. I have to start looking out for my own wellbeing.” 

I also wanted an environment that resembled where I grew up. I grew up in a small town in the heart of North Carolina, and I wanted to be in a similar place for college.

Lo and behold: I embark on my second college campus tour, Appalachian State. The environment was just what I was looking for. A small town where (pretty much) everyone was welcoming. Felt exactly like a home away from home. 

It also helped that my tour guide was a business major. (I forget exactly what her major was, but I know it fell under the umbrella of business majors), so that was a huge click.",2024-04-23 22:23:12

Sometimes your admissions lead you to unexpected places, that, while outside of the typical niche you thought you wanted, end up being just right for you. At the end of the day, it's all still school and there will always be an opportunity if you can fight for it.

One of the T1 schools here is also the only school in the district to offer IB, so it really depends on what your school offers for the higher achieving kids.

I am super grateful to get to make this decision, but for the time being it is very stressful and I have next to no clue what the ""right"" choice to make is.***

*Intended major: Settled on Mechanical Engineering for the past few years, planning to complete a master's degree*

**Primary considerations:**

* COST, family isn't low or high-income, and weird circumstances mean next year aid will probably be much worse than freshman year.
* Looking for grad placement either at another university with a fellowship OR at the school I attend for undergraduate with aid and/or 4+1 program.
* Hoping to not end up as a super STEM-pointy student; I'd like to develop as a well-rounded adult with an educated understanding outside of just my major.

**Duke**

Duke Pros:

* Super crazy awesome campus with four years of on-campus housing
* Very well ranked + has name brand for consulting + finance jobs if I sell my soul
* Great resources in Pratt
* Excellent education outside of engineering
* Smaller classes and great student-faculty ratio
* 4+1 program
* Surrounded by very ambitious students (cool atmosphere imo)

Duke Cons:

* Cost is great for the first year (equal to in-state NCSU), but we expect worse aid next year. Could commit with the intention of transferring if it's an issue (kinda okay with that)
* People stereotype Duke students as very entitled + other bad things
* Might not have as much research opportunity in MechE outside of materials

**Georgia Tech**

Tech Pros:

* Big name with lots of recruitment (#3 for MechE)
* In Atlanta near relatives
* Huge amounts of research opportunity
* 4+1 program

Georgia Tech Cons:

* Would require 10K debt/year
* Minimal liberal arts focus

**NC State University**

NCSU Pros:

* Affordable for all four years w/ in-state cost + some scholarship
* Large + solid engineering program
* More research opportunities for MechE than Duke
* Honors program so seminar + exploratory learning opportunities
* 4+1 program and better grad than undergrad school prestige

NCSU Cons:

* Massive school with arguably less ambitious/accomplished students than other options
* Not as well-ranked / sought after by employers
* Brick campus :(

**WILD CARD: UNC-Chapel Hill**

UNC Pros:

* Offered great scholarship money so super affordable
* Honors program
* Loved everything about the UNC campus + vibe
* Strong name value / prestigious

UNC Cons:

* **No engineering program** - Would have to explore and mildly find new identity + life goals (could be a pro).
* If physics major or applied sciences, couldn't do affordable in-state masters at NCSU as easily since they prefer students who did undergrad in the major they apply to grad school for.

**Texas A &amp; M**

TAMU pros:

* Great engineering program + job placement
* Very affordable with scholarship money
* Research opportunities

My choices are UNH Durham campus or UMaine honors college at the Orono campus. Cost aside, UNH has a nicer campus overall and I can pretty confidently say that I like the school better than UMaine. The problem that I am having is that, although UMaine honors college is cheaper by around 10k per year and I may get a more in depth education from the small class sizes, I like UNH better and it seems far more likely to find a  better job out of UNH. UMaine’s low graduation rate of under 60% worries me too. Another thing to note is that UNH has no BA major for finance so I would have to do financial economics if I were to attend. My family can afford UNH but it is likely to put more of a financial burden on me in the future. What do you guys think? I’ve come to the conclusion that I am likely to enjoy either school but I just don’t know what would be better. I have put an unhealthy amount of thought into this and I am curious what others think is the best choice. I ruled out Bentley, Hofstra, and Fordham for being too expensive, and RIT for being too much of an engineering school to go to for business.

Ultimately what matters for you to get a job that you want is having the skills and education to perform that job. That has very little to do with the name on your degree and practically nothing to do with it once you’re talking about major research universities, which Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz are. CS and Data Science are not completely unrelated, but I wouldn’t say the choice involves a “slight hit” in your major. You will have very different skills at the end of your degree program depending on which you major in, and while you can certainly pursue jobs with either degree, you will have more work to do if you don’t major in the field you want your first job to be in. 

That doesn’t mean that there aren’t differences between the schools. If you were admitted to an identical major at both, I would suggest you look at things that come down to preference in making your choice. For example, does one offer classes that the other doesn’t? Or a specific outside the classroom opportunity? Or does one cost significantly less? While your desired major should make your decision for you, those may still be factors that you should consider. 

This is an aside, but I’ll add that UCs are not better than CSUs. They’re very different kinds of schools. CSUs are teaching colleges with smaller class sizes, direct instruction by professors, and a focus on job placement. UCs are research universities, with larger class sizes and professors focused on publishing papers and writing grants. Differences in type of institution matter a lot more for whether any given school is right for you than differences in brand strength. ",2024-04-24 00:16:33

**RPI I got into Computer Science but can easily dual with CE or just switch**  
I prefer computer engineering currently and ideally want to transfer out tho only like 90% sure (and im p sure grades and prestige matter here)  
Also both schools have pretty good computer engineering professors (tho their CE ranks are p much the same and UMass obv has better CS program)  
**UMass Pros:**  
+Food  
+Campus/community/sports  
+Closer to home + Boston sports  
+Honors college: Classes and dorms  
+Better infrastructure (I can fit in their desks)  
+More variety majors  
+More people (like 28k?)  
+Bigger sports scene  
+50/50 Gender ratio  
+Cheaper by 13k per year  
+Pretty nice vibe  
**Cons:**  
-Less prestigious  
-Lots of people I know are going  
-No dual major CS/CE i think (if it does exist pls let me know...or even CS transfer)  
-My parents prefer RPI  
-Harder to get into some classes  
-Lower expected salary  
-Less advanced classes offered (RF in particular)

**RPI Pros:**  
+Easily dual major CS/CE (like 4 more classes)  
+Higher expected salary (120k?) and apparent 100% job rate  
+Near Albany (not really too familiar w/ the city so pls lmk how it is)  
+Everyone is a tech guy (pro and con)  
+More advanced classes offered  
+Former T20 and more prestigious  
+Companies know RPI more (more hire)  
+Quantum and Supercomputers  
+Parents like  
+Suite style dorms are p cool  
**Cons:**  
-Old campus and infrastructure  
-Further from home + NY sports  
-70/30 Gender ratio  
-Everyone is a tech guy  
-Troy doesn't look that great and seems a bit unsafe around the area  
-Doesn't seem like much to do  
-More expensive  
-Worse CS Program  
-1/5 people (like 7.5k)  
-Small campus  
-L Food  
-Cant fit in the lecture hall desks comfortably :(

Generally I like UMass' campus and size (and food) a lot more but am aware that RPI is much more prestigious and generally has better academics. Also there's the factor of cost and transfer and internships and I've been really really torn over this for a while now and would really like some help and more information if possible such as over UMass dual and internship ease from both schools and whatnot.  
thanks.

Usually this is supposed to take two years if you go full-time but some non-relevant circumstances prevented me from graduating in just two years, so it's taken me 3 years.

It's also important to mention that thanks to some legal agreements, my parents cover 4 consecutive years of college after high school, after which my mom will continue to help me out, though my dad will not. 

I'm about to graduate from community college, and I've applied to 3 transfer schools, two of which are in-state. Initially I applied for the political science programs at all three universities about 6 months ago, but with some of the courses I've taken it made me realize I want to do something involving more data science and environmental related things, two things I have a stronger passion for. I know it seems weird to change my mind this late in the game, but I thought I was so far down the totem pole when it came to the classes I didn't have done, versus what would be required for programs in those fields.

Anyway, so I'm really stuck between 2 of these universities as the 3rd one I don't really want to go to as I need a change of scenery and it's too close of a location with too much traffic. My first option is University of Florida which is in-state. The tuition is cheap, I enjoyed the campus and it's a highly reputable school. However, I applied back in early October 2023 as a transfer for PoliSci, and nearly 7 months later, have still yet to hear anything. UF admits themselves that it is ""highly unlikely"" that you will be able to change your major after getting admitted. By comparison to say, UCF, they seem to overlook transfer students looking to go there.

My other university in mind is Virginia Tech. This is where my parents went, as well as some other family members. VT definitely seems more transfer friendly, has a beautiful campus and many programs to offer. Even better, I recently got accepted as a PoliSci transfer (even though it's probably not a degree path I'd want to continue to go down). Thankfully, VT seems more understanding and open about letting people switch their major, as they have much more info on that. The biggest downside is that since it is out-of-state, it is VERY expensive. I thought about getting a place off-campus for this year so by fall 2025, I'd be eligible for in-state so long as I had my t's crossed and I'd dotted for that to happen, but I'm not sure about that plan either.

If I decided to accept VT, I would have to let them know by June 1st. However the decision deadline for UF (as in the deadline for them to let ME know if I'm in) is June 15th. So, it's likely by the time I have to give VT a response, I won't even know what UF says. I feel like neither choice here is that fantastic, and my mom even suggested I take a gap year, but I'm really not sure about it since then I don't have guaranteed coverage from both my parents, and I'd hate to put more of a financial burden \*exclusively\* on one parent. Of course, I'd still do my best to get scholarships, pay the difference, etc. but I feel like I'm just between a rock and a hard place here. If anyone has any suggestions or ideas, it'd be greatly appreciated. Thanks a bunch.",2024-04-24 01:09:48

I intend to work either in biotech / research in the future, so not premed

at UCSD, I'm a molecular &amp; cell bio major and my college is ERC

* I'm in-state, so I'll get in-state tuition!
* SD is a biotech hub, so I'm hoping the opportunities will be really great there

HOWEVER, I'm worried I'm passing up a super great opportunity:

I got into UIUC for bioengineering, and I'm wondering if the Grainger prestige is just more worth it?

* my tuition will be OOS tuition (\~60k), and I'll have to get there by plane, which will add up
   * my family can cover most of the tuition, and I'll maybe have to take out \~12k in loans per year
* is UIUC even that great for bioengineering or is it better for the other engineering disciplines?
   * i've heard a lot about it being T5 engineering, so would that translate to better job opportunities?

my other top options are:

* UCSB as a pre-bio major
* UW as a pre-engineering major (on the bioE track) + a small scholarship
* Purdue as a cell, molecular &amp; developmental biology major + honors college

essentially, I'm wondering if I should consider UIUC, or if I should just go with what I was initially going with?

I wouldn’t say I got that feeling until about a month into my freshman year of college.

My intended major is electrical engineering, but like a dumbass, I didn't apply to the engineering school at either UCSD or UCLA. I'm already very familiar with UCSD, so I was hoping someone from UCLA would provide me with perspective and help me compare the schools.

UCSD pros:

* I already have a pathway planned out to transfer to electrical engineering before the end of my first year, which includes taking linear algebra in cc. since I did well in physics in high school and will brush up my math during the summer, transferring into ee should be highly likely for me.
* correct me if I'm wrong, but i am currently under the impression that ucsd is better for both engineering and cognitive science compared to UCLA. I'm interested in either double majoring or minoring in cogsci because I like the design aspect of it
* cogsci research is plentiful for undergrads and ece isn't too bad either

UCSD cons:

* ""socially dead""
* they put me in eleanor roosevelt college, widely considered the college with the worst ge requirements.

UCLA pros:

* i applied for cs + linguistics in the college of arts and sciences, and my friend in ucla ee said these types of students tend to have an easier time transferring into engineering
* better food, 4 year housing guaranteed (as opposed to just two years at SD). Overall, I like LA's campus significantly more
* i feel like westwood has more things to do compared to la jolla?
* PrEsTiGe
* much better art program, but can I even involve myself in the more advanced stuff if I'm a non-major?

I think the deciding factors for me would be (numbered in order of importance)

1. what's the process for transferring into electrical engineering from cs + linguistics? Are the screening courses and prereqs similar to UCSD? I don't want to take my cc math classes for nothing
2. how rigorous is LA's engineering program compared to SD?
3. Since LA has way more people, is it difficult to form connections with professors?
4. how plentiful are research opportunities for undergrads? do most engineering students get internships by their sophomore summer?
5. how accessible is the visual art/design program for non-majors?
6. if a ucla engineering student applied to transfer out of ucla to a similarly ranked school, would they see more success than the same student at ucsd?

I'm a Senior high school student from the country Georgia (It's in the Caucasus) and I applied to 15 universities: Harvard, Princeton, Notre Dame, Cornell, Amherst, Northwestern, Washington University in saint Louis, Swarthmore, Stanford, Williams College, Bates College, Case Western Reserve, Lafayette, Skidmore, Union and Trinity College. Yes, I admit that this university is the best of the best, nevertheless, my financial struggles can't allow me to study in a place where there aren't any 100% financial aid coverings. The major I want to pursue is Aerospace Engineering or something related to that topic (for instance: Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or even Economics).

I had a 9.78/10 GPA from the best National public STEM school (Beforehand, I was studying in the second most renowned public STEM school), 1490 SAT (710 Lang., 780 Math), 108 Toefl IBT (First Try) and Many extracurriculars and honors. Honors: National Math Olympiad Finalist 2 times, National Economics Olympiad Finalist, National Physics Olympiad Semi-finalist, and Placed in the school hall of fame as an exceptional student. 

As for extracurriculars, I had an Internship in the innovations and technology agency of the government for 6 months, was the Mentor and The judge of the NASA Space Apps challenge in my country and government Hackathon which was funded by the European Union, and was Founder of the club that is dedicated to helping foster children with resources and education, Semi level multi-instrumentalist (Guitar and Georgian Drums), Competitor of Georgia's biggest Hardware Startup ecosystem program, The best student of MIT offline course of machine learning and it's real-life applications. As for hobby activities: Gardener of 1300m\^2 of land, Main actor of the Drama Club, and Intermediate Aikidoka. This is my brief review of the projects I delved into. 

The recommendations I had were also spectacular, one of them was from MIT PH.D. students of Aerospace and Statistics, and it was filled with anecdotes, evidence, etc... the second recommendation was from the founder of the National Economics Foundation, and he also made it clear that I am a great applicant, as for the other recommendations (3 out of 5) there were great but I can't describe them as magnificent.

I can't say that my essays are my weak point, they were great I think.

So I'm frustrated about the fact that I got rejected from all of the universities (I haven't even gotten interviews from the universties, except Princeton). Nevertheless, I want to get an academic year and reapply next year. My hope is long-lasting :). I'm here to ask what may be the reason for my rejection, what are my weak points and how can I transform my negatives into positives.

Everyone knows that if you need help, you should ask Reddit for it :3.

Thank you, I'm waiting for your responses.",2024-04-24 04:00:57

3133,t3_1cbssp4,1713946111.0,"Hello everyone! I'm planning to study in the US, and I'm hoping to get a scholarship based on financial need because my parents earn less than $20,000 per year due to high inflation. I'm not sure if I'm an average student or above average, but let me share my achievements so you can gauge my level.

GED Scores:

* Reading and Language Arts: 158
* Math: 170
* Science: 175
* Social Studies: 168

SAT Score: 1330 (My practice SAT scores ranged from 1290 to 1390)

Extracurricular Activities:  
I don't have much volunteer experience, but I'm deeply interested in Computer Science (CS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I've been studying them since I was 15 and have earned five certificates:

* CS50x from Harvard
* ML certificate from Stanford
* CS50AI (still need to finish assignments for the certificate)
* Kaggle
* TryHackMe
* Udemy

I'm also trying to start a side hustle. Additionally, I've had to drop out of high school due to a dictatorship and war in my country. However, I've been studying math independently and have completed precalculus. I'm currently working on calculus. When I say studying, I don't just mean watching videos; I also practice math problems from workbooks. The main thing I want to highlight is that even though I didn't attend high school, I've used free resources from the internet to fill that gap. I am also writing personal statement. 

My question is, can I get into US universities? If I'm accepted, will I qualify for financial need scholarships or something similar? I'd really appreciate your opinions as I'm applying to universities for this fall.

3143,t1_l10niwl,1713948445.0,"There are roughly 2,600 four-year schools in the US.  When it comes to financial aid/merit scholarships for international students, they each fall into one of five buckets:

1. **Need-Blind** — these schools do not consider an international student’s ability to pay when making admissions decisions, and will meet 100% of your demonstrated financial need if you are accepted. There are roughly a half-dozen of these schools: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Amherst, Dartmouth, Bowdoin, and I think Brown will be for next year.  These schools are extraordinarily competitive private schools, which reject the vast, vast majority of international and domestic applicants based on academics and other non-financial criteria.
2. **Need-Aware, Generous** — these schools (&lt;50 or so?) do consider an international student’s ability to pay when making admissions decisions, so you will need to be an extraordinarily qualified applicant to overcome that impediment. (Like, essentially good enough to get into the Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc tier schools in the first bucket.) but, if you do get in, these schools will meet 100% of your demonstrated financial need. Personally, I have a problem calling any school “generous” that rejects most international students simply based on their need for aid… but most people will characterize these schools as “generous to international students.”
3. **Need-Aware, Not-So-Generous** — these schools (&lt;50 or so?) also consider an international students ability to pay when making an admissions decision. But they are typically less selective than the 2nd group. (But you will still need to be an extremely qualified applicant to get accepted.) If accepted, these schools might offer partial scholarships, but you should plan to cover much of the cost of attending on your own.
4. **Need-Aware, No-Money** — these are mostly private schools that consider an international student’s ability to pay when making admissions decisions, and will simply reject you if you cannot pay.
5. **Need-Don’t-Give-A-Shit** — the rest of the schools in the US — including pretty much every public university — don’t consider your need for financial aid one way or the other.  Which is to say that they will happily admit international (and domestic) applicants who cannot possibly afford to attend… and then provide them no need-based aid whatsoever. There are a handful that do provide partial merit-based scholarhsips, but not-full rides. Ultimately, however, getting admitted to a school you can’t afford to attend is no better than being rejected.

The unfortunate reality is that, statistically speaking, the likelihood of an international applicant needing significant aid being accepted to a US university that is willing to meet their financial need is extraordinarily low.",2024-04-24 04:47:25

Georgetown's location in DC doesn't really confer any advantage over Dartmouth when it comes to networking and professional opportunities, except in some very specific cases (working for a policy/security think tank/NGO or for the federal government, for example), but the Dartmouth name will open doors for you in those fields too.

I have a recent college grad who is earning very low six-figures with no debt, and a $900 student loan payment would definitely be missed in terms of saving for a down payment on a home and contributing to a vacation fund. Also, I’m not certain I’d bank on working very many hours during the academic year. Engineering is a very tough and time-consuming curriculum. When you aren’t in class, in labs, working on projects, or studying, it would be optimal if you could join friends in clubs, attend a basketball game, work out in the gym, or otherwise take advantage of university life and take care of yourself. 

But I guess one question for me is how certain you are that Purdue will give you a significantly “lesser” experience than UW-Madison after one visit.  Have you reviewed the club offerings at each to see if both offered clubs that you would enjoy? Have you looked up the classes, intramurals, and outdoors activities offered at both student recreation centers?  I’d be a bit surprised if they didn’t offer similar intramural sports; hiking and camping trips; and rec center classes in kayaking, dance, scuba, and yoga.  Have you read the online university newspapers to get a better sense of student vibe and interest?  Have you watched Purdue and Wisconsin home basketball and football games to assure yourself that both universities have lively and spirited students?  Finally, have you checked out the course requirements and electives in your major at each school to determine if the academic differences are meaningful?

I’d also note anecdotally that my recent college grads were underwhelmed by their first visit to the T25 they ultimately attended.  It took a second visit where we focused more on student life and skipped the university tour entirely to seal the deal.  And they had a terrific four years.  But, that being said, I do believe that they could have had an equally good experience at many other universities that offer a mix of solid academics, spirited college athletics, an active club culture, and a work hard/play hard vibe. Penn State, The University of Minnesota, and UMD also would have given them a terrific experience.  I mention this just in case the differences you noticed may be less significant to your day-to-day experience than you imagine. 

Also, have you talked with any student ambassadors at Purdue about your concerns?  Admissions or the engineering department should be able to introduce you to current students for a chat.  And you can always post on the Purdue subreddit with any questions.  Good luck!",2024-04-24 06:53:53

While NYUSH does not have a an IR major it does have a Global Chinese Studies program and if you study away at NY you could work to get a minor in IR at Wagner. 

Landing a job out of NYUSH is based upon your major and  how well you are able to network given it is in Shanghai. US companies are not coming to Shanghai as part of large job fairs like they would in US. Harder to connect with people out of SH than USA. So for the business and marketing major you will need to begin networking, finding internships right away. But learning to network is a skill and if you put yourself out there early on you will develop that skill more at SH. 

If you decided to go toward an IR career people have landed positions with Department of State as recent as last year. I do believe being in China, networking with expats at IR and other global risk type events does provide you a leg up in the IR field.

As to the other factors, only you know how you feel about them. My high-achieving kids were fairly adamant that they wanted to be within a four-hour drive from home and were happy to attend any of our very solid state schools.

I'm also mostly undecided, but I definitely favour the humanities and subjects like economics, anthropology, and maybe law. Cost is not too much of an issue for me.


**Vassar**


Vassar Pros:

- Open curriculum (I'd love to take a lot of different classes, even art electives)

- Campus life (everything is provided/available within an enclosed campus)

- Good for pre-law
 
- Small undergraduate college so its more personalised, and has a nice campus

Vassar Cons:

- Far from a city (it's 2 hours from NYC but most activity is concentrated on campus since Poughkeepsie is a small town)

- Far from any countries I have relatives in 

- Mostly a 4 year academic program (compared to 3 years in UK where I could get a job more easily after)

- Might not be as well known outside the US (for masters or employment)


**King's College London**


King's Pros:

- A good law degree in 3 years (which I could use in most commonwealth countries, and the courses look interesting, and I could start employment after if I want to)

- London (so lots of internships and things to do)

- Close to Paris (Family there, good for internships too since I can speak French fluently)

King's Cons:

- Only law for 3 years/not flexible curriculum (If I don't like it I could probably just suffer through it for 3 years but I'd rather not)

- No campus to speak off, dorms are spread around the city, need to be more autonomous


**McGill**


McGill Pros:

- Flexible curriculum (but limited sometimes, with poli science focussing on Canada)

- Montréal, which is bilingual (I can maintain my French!) and a big city (internships, things to do...)

- Cheaper

- Campus life (everything on site)

McGill Cons:

- Far from any relatives

- If I end up wanting to do law, both Vassar and King's would be better?

- I'm not sure where it stands compared to the two universities above in term of brand recognition/prestige internationally

As for outcomes, major matters more than college.  Your outcomes may also be very different depending on the region of the country.

All the rankings serve one purpose and one purpose only - to sell advertising for the group generating them. What school is “best” for you depends on what you want to do after college, how you learn, where you want to be during and after college, what type of environment you enjoy (big v mid v small, big sports v no sports, weather, party v quiet), cost and the type of student who attends. A large amount of first gen or Pell may be important to one student but meaningless to another.(both USNWR ranking factors)

If you must, I think the best method is to take 6-7 rankings, drop the highest and lowest grade for each school (to remove outliers), and then average out the results. Then you might have some idea of at least the perceived value/prestige of each school in terms of tiers (there is no difference in ranking difference of a few slots one way or the other).

3238,t1_l11gkjd,1713964578.0,"For many students, the college admissions and decisions process is the first time that you really get to make a major decision about your life. When we’re kids, typically our parents make the big decisions for us, and our decisions are smaller — which friends to make, how much to study, which extracurriculars.

It’s absolutely normal to have some regret or anxiety any time you make a big decision in life — which medical specialty? Do you want to have kids? Should you move your family in order to pursue a career promotion?

Any time we say yes to something, we’re also saying no to other options. That’s true for anything, even down to deciding what you each for lunch. But choosing a college is probably the first time you’ve had to make a REALLY BIG decision that can affect the future course of your life. Having some doubts or wondering about your choices is normal. Welcome to being an adult!

It might help to write down your reasons for your original decision and your doubts. Write down pro and con lists for both schools, if you haven’t already done that. Probably you would have felt a bit of regret no matter which decision you would have made. That’s normal. 

I think you’re very self-aware. You have clear reasons why you chose the more expensive school, and you think it will be a better fit and set you up for your career. Only you can know your parents, but unless you have a good reason not to, trust them when they say they can afford the school you chose. This Reddit is full of people advising not to take on debt for college, but it sounds like you wouldn’t have significant debt because your parents can pay. That’s a gift — it’s okay to accept it.

I’m a private college counselor now and it’s been  over a decade since I was in college, but when I was in your same position I also chose the more expensive dream school (Princeton even though UChicago offered me a rare academic merit partial scholarship), because my parents said it was okay. It was the right decision for me, but it was still a challenging decision that April.

As others have noted, if it truly doesn’t feel right after the first year, you can always transfer. But it sounds like you’ve already made a pretty good decision, and you’re just having absolutely normal emotions about it.",2024-04-24 09:16:18

I don't mean to be unsympathetic, and you don't have to actually like any of this.  But there is a real disconnect in worldview here.

The actual truth is the potential wealth advantages in educational and childhood development start in private day cares (actually even before that with prenatal care), continue through private preschools, private K-12s, private colleges, and finally right through private graduate and professional schools.

Some non-wealthy people break into this system at some point with the help of scholarships.  But that is the exception and not the rule.  Most kids from non-wealthy families go to public schools from the start through the end of their education.

And of course I understand why some kids want to be one of those exceptions, and they may choose college as their attempted point of entry into this track.  But only so many kids are going to be able to jump tracks from the public system to the private system at that juncture, at least if you are hoping for one of the most selective private colleges in the US.  And the competition to be one of those few who jump tracks at that point is intense, and many kids fail.

Whereas more people who were on that track from the beginning succeed, because that is how the world works.  Which is actually what the people trying to jump tracks want, they want those advantages going forward.

I can work 20 hours a week on campus and can earn $12.83/h (25th percentile)  and also my income from co-op would be $20/h (25th percentile) according to drexels salary structure.

Drexel Pros:

* It offers accounting
* Has a really good co-op program which can range from 1 co-op (4 year degree) to 3 co-ops (5 year degree).
* I can generate 75% of my college fee after aid through working part-time at the university and 3 co-ops.
* Received Dean's scholarship.
* Accounting is the second most popular major at drexel.
* Produces career-oriented graduates.
* Situated in the heart of Philadelphia
* Has a great international community.

Drexel Cons:

* Not good in ranking (Ranked 98 in national universities)
* Has a very high acceptance rate (79.6%)
* More expensive if I choose the 1 co-op 4 year program.
* Does not have a proper campus.

Denison Pros:

* $9068 Cheaper then drexel.
* Good in ranking. (Ranked 39 in national liberal arts colleges)
* Has a low acceptance rate. (17%)
* Has a proper university campus.
* Situated near Columbus.

Besides I have great teachers that believe in me. I worked hard for my admission and with the help of my great parents, I am able to fund my college. Now that I met my fellow classmates I noticed that, everybody that I have spoken to until now, comes from a high class family and attended private school. Most of them are really wealthy, which is understandable because of the price of the college.

A lot are moaning about the workload and call themselves 'survivors'. I don't really mind to work that hard, and can't handle their complaints to be honest.

I feel like having imposter syndrome, especially because they have different standards than I do (like differents budgets). I am currently really happy with my high school, because we come from the same social and economic environment, which is making me doubt about attending the prestigious college. The education is great tho and it opens up a lot of opportunities. Most people tell me that the program fits perfect with me, and I completely agree, but I already feel like I don't belong there. Everybody seems so smart and unlike others, I will be part-time working next to my degree to get sufficient financial funds.

UK cons:

&gt;i really just don't get how that's ""100%"" of my need met.

It's whatever UPenn thinks is ""oh, this can be met"". This might mean dipping through retirement funds and/or selling your house (yes, outside very few schools like Princeton, most schools presume primary residence and retirement funds as part of 'liquid assets').

For instance, maybe your parents make $200k a year. Then UPenn might think ""clearly this family can afford $43k a year for 4 years"". Or maybe your parents make $100k a year but has a $4 million retirement account. Then again, ""clearly this family can afford $43k a year for 4 years"" and so forth.

&gt;my parents have a business and a vacant property but we are by no means affluent

That is the very definition of affluent. If you have more than 1 primary residence, you are definitely in a privileged position. Just because a family does not have billions does not mean they aren't affluent. $2 million in net worth is already 90th percentile in the US.

A vacant property and business might put your family in the 97th percentile in the US. And by percentile, 97th percentile in the US is plenty 'affluent' by any metric.

In fact, 99th percentile net worth in US is only $13.5 million. So ya.. welcome to the real world. Now, is any of this enough for private jets? Nope. But that doesn't change the definition of 'affluent'.

What people are seeing in TV of 'affluent' is more like the 0.0000003% in the US (people like Bezos).",2024-04-24 11:26:11

Haven't visited either campus, so have based my perception about the student life at both from stuff I read online.  
Any input is appreciated.

**Cornell**

**Pros:**

* **Great course offerings:** I can basically take whatever I want in any subject. I’m particularly interested in exploring courses and opportunities in economics, urban design, and the arts, which are all well-known there.
* **The alumni network:** I have heard this mentioned a lot in other posts, but I don’t know how much this weighs in fields other than finance. How much does this “Ivy network” reputation help in maybe the startup or tech scenes? Can anyone share how this network may have helped their career?
* **The diversity of people:** Since there are so many specialized schools, I can probably branch out and meet a lot more different people from various backgrounds compared to JHU, where I heard the majority are pursuing pre-med, so there might not be as much diversity in interests or pursuits.
* **Nature:** I am really excited about the hikes, swimming in the lake, exploring the botanical garden, and the ski trips at Greek Peak during winter.

**Cons:**

* **Academic Flexibility:** Despite the course-taking flexibility, I have heard that the process of transferring to a different college or major could be difficult—with the extensive prerequisites for certain majors, I can see how my course selection may be limited even starting in my freshman year.
* **Social life:** I have heard that the social scene can be pretty “clique-y” there, where students mostly interact with others in the same college or circle.
* **Grade deflation:** Although I am pretty decent at handling high workloads, I just hope that the grade deflation and academic pressure there won’t require me to consume all my free time, taking my time to explore opportunities and branch out.

**Cornell Summary:**  
I have all these really great visions about taking interesting courses and interacting with people at Cornell, but I just fear that the cons I listed could potentially overturn all of that (limited by the flexibility and social scene, I might not get to take full advantage of the opportunities).

**Johns Hopkins**

**Pros:**

* **Academic flexibility:** Not admitted by major, so I get to take any classes in the first few semesters without too much worry about fulfilling prerequisites for majors and can switch pretty easily even after declaring.
* **Research opportunities:** I have heard anecdotes that it is pretty easy to land research positions there even as an undergrad, and the funding is quite generous.
* **Smaller school, tighter community:** The social scene might be less “clique-y” than what might be at Cornell?

**Cons:**

* **Pre-med focus:** I am not looking to pursue medicine, so I fear that its resources in other fields might not be as abundant (compared to Cornell, of course). Though I am not opposed to doing biology-related studies (I have done some biology-related research before and quite enjoyed it).
* **Location:** Less access to nature than I would prefer. But this is not too much of a deciding factor for me.

**JHU Summary:**  
Honestly, I couldn’t think of too many pros and cons for it. It seems like a safer school to choose, and I can definitely see myself enjoying my time there, but it just doesn’t have the plethora of diverse opportunities that Cornell offers, which I am really drawn to.

**Summary:**  
Cornell has always been at the top of my list since day one, but now, having heard and read negative aspects (the social scene, the academics, the culture), it seems like JHU (where there is more flexibility and people seem to be slightly happier) might be a better choice.

I am very grateful to have the opportunity to choose between the two, and I also understand that college is what I make of it. But I still hope I can gather some advice or personal experiences in relation to the points I listed, so any input is greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-04-24 11:57:11

This is something we are working through with her psychiatrist. I say that because I don’t think this is not a college issue. It might be an issue with how you feel about yourself and your own special worth. 

Now, on to what is a college issue. I have another child who wasn’t sure what she wanted to major in, wasn’t sure if she wanted a large school or a small school, or a private school or a public school. She didn’t even have a preference for a certain part of the country. 

She ended up getting the list down to 8 schools where she was accepted with merit and which were affordable to our family. You would think that was a good thing. 

Instead, it sent her into a spiral of pressure to “choose the right one.” She kept telling me that she had expected to only get into one school and not have to make a choice. 

Some family members were adding to her stress by warning of bad choices they had made picking schools and how unhappy they were there. 

I explained to her that our family members were the kind of people who have a precise vision of what they want, and tend to be rigid when needing to adapt. 

I reminded her that she is the opposite. She was standing in a clearing with 8 paths before her, but she has the capacity and determination to be happy and successful at the end of any of them. 

There were no bad options, she just needed to choose based on her preference, because “Life tends to turn out for those who make the best of how life turns out.”  

But then she panicked because how was she supposed to know what her preferences were? 

A mentor told her to visit the schools again and just sit in the library at each one and ask, “Does this feel like it could be home someday?”

She ended up choosing the honors college at the state flagship and has never regretted it. 

So try to ask yourself why you think you are not deserving of a gift that your parents planned to give you, can afford to give you, and are happy to give you. 

Then forget about if you made the right choice. Start walking the path you have chosen with confidence that there will be barriers along the way, but you have all of the ingenuity, flexibility and persistence to turn every negative to your advantage. 

Best of luck to you! Don’t let your brain steal the joy of the gift your parents are giving you and the exciting and productive adventure you are embarking upon.",2024-04-24 12:37:24
3384,t1_l12fabm,1713976733.0,"There are roughly 2,600 four-year schools in the US.  When it comes to financial aid/merit scholarships for international students, they each fall into one of five buckets:

1. **Need-Blind** — these schools do not consider an international student’s ability to pay when making admissions decisions, and will meet 100% of your demonstrated financial need if you are accepted. There are roughly a half-dozen of these schools: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Amherst, Dartmouth, Bowdoin, and I think Brown will be for next year.  These schools are extraordinarily competitive private schools, which reject the vast, vast majority of international and domestic applicants based on academics and other non-financial criteria. Only two of these schools provide merit scholarships.
2. **Need-Aware, Generous** — these schools (&lt;50 or so?) do consider an international student’s ability to pay when making admissions decisions, so you will need to be an extraordinarily qualified applicant to overcome that impediment. (Like, essentially good enough to get into the Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc tier schools in the first bucket.) but, if you do get in, these schools will meet 100% of your demonstrated financial need. Personally, I have a problem calling any school “generous” that rejects most international students simply based on their need for aid… but most people will characterize these schools as “generous to international students.”
3. **Need-Aware, Not-So-Generous** — these schools (&lt;50 or so?) also consider an international students ability to pay when making an admissions decision. But they are typically less selective than the 2nd group. (But you will still need to be an extremely qualified applicant to get accepted.) If accepted, these schools might offer partial scholarships, but you should plan to cover much of the cost of attending on your own.
4. **Need-Aware, No-Money** — these are mostly private schools that consider an international student’s ability to pay when making admissions decisions, and will simply reject you if you cannot pay.
5. **Need-Don’t-Give-A-Shit** — the rest of the schools in the US — including pretty much every public university — don’t consider your need for financial aid one way or the other.  Which is to say that they will happily admit international (and domestic) applicants who cannot possibly afford to attend… and then provide them no need-based aid whatsoever. There are a handful that do provide partial merit-based scholarhsips, but not-full rides. Ultimately, however, getting admitted to a school you can’t afford to attend is no better than being rejected.

The unfortunate reality is that, statistically speaking, the likelihood of an international applicant needing significant aid being accepted to a US university that is willing to meet their financial need is extraordinarily low.",2024-04-24 12:38:53

Come colleges claim to be 'need blind' in admission while others state up-front they are 'need aware'.

Wes's open curriculum would be better if you wanted to triple major (kids actually do it there).

The art scene at Wes is extremely vibrant. Dartmouth has amazing art facilities and instruction.

Like, 30 years ago, people were making the same sorts of arguments about the imminent death of these institutions.  This was at the height of the Gingrich era, and the anti-PC (""political correctness"") fervor.   For example, the movie PCU came out in 1994.  And in the early 1990s, Harvard College, say, was getting about 15000 applications per year.

Well, we know what happened next.  Harvard College applications doubled by 2010, and this year were over 54000--over 3.5 times as many as during the anti-PC era that supposedly was signaling the end of their desirability.  Oh, but after a ton of bad press, Harvard College applications were down about 3K from last year--doooooom!

For good or ill, the truth is these colleges know what they are doing, and they will adjust and survive and grow in brand value again.

Now that said, it has ALWAYS been a dubious proposition that these colleges were worth a bunch of debt versus a top flagship or such.  That's not at all a new observation, and it is definitely worth considering.

3437,t3_1cc4xu7,1713981530.0,"**Background:** White male from suburban central Pennsylvania. I go to a slightly above-average school that has a class size of 700. Divorced parents with 180k combined income. No legacy status at any elite university.

**Intended Major:** I'd like to apply as a Math major to some of the more competitive schools that allow undergrads to transfer to CS, but for the schools that don't, I'm applying to CS.

**Academics:**

GPA: Weighted 103.1/100 97/100 UW - 30/681 rank (didn't do as good in 9th grade)

SAT: 1560 (800M, 760 EBRW)

PSAT: 1500 (760M, 740 EBRW)

APs: 11 APs and 5 DE classes (5s on all 3 currently taken and taking 3 this year and 4 next year) - I'm taking Discrete Mathematics and Calculus III through a community college which is 4 years ahead of my school's curriculum

**ECS:** (Where I currently stand)

1) Math Summer Enrichment Program

I created a summer program for middle schoolers that will be primarily focused on competition math. It will likely be around 50 students and will take place over the entire summer.

2) Development Internship

I will be virtually interning at a company that is focused on web-design and application development this summer.

3) IT Internship

I will be interning alongside a business that is focused on IT solutions for small-scale businesses. This includes network security, hardware, etc

4) Founder of Coding Club

I cofounded and am the co-president of our school's coding club. Our club has 30 members and we have entered into a few competitions. Through the club, I founded our school's American Computer Science League. Additionally, we have the possibility of placing at this year's Congressional App Challenge.

5) Competition Math

I have 2 team first-place placements at state-level math competitions, and a 5th place individual and 2nd place team at a lesser-known national math competition. I'm planning on qualifying for AIME next school year, but this won't be until after EA/ED.

6) Part-Time Job

I've been working at Best Buy for a year now, and I have been promoted to sales representative for Meta through the company. It's nothing crazy, but I work 15 hours weekly

(Here's where the list gets shaky)

7) Guitar

I've been playing electric and acoustic guitar since I was 10, but I haven't performed at any concerts and am not part of a band.

8) Drone Racing

As a hobby, I've been drone racing since 2020. While I haven't done anything significant with it, I believe that putting it on my application would show a unique character. I also think that I can connect it to my college essays in a good way.

(At this point, I'm not sure what my 9 and 10 are going to be. However, here are some possibilities)

Baseball Umpire

I was an umpire for little league baseball, however, I only did it during 9th and 10th grade, so I'm not sure if it's worth putting on my app.

Travel Baseball

I played travel baseball at the state level from ages 10 through 15, but again, it was only until 10th grade.

Student Council

At the time of application, I will have been on the student council for 3 years. However, I don't have any significant leadership in it, so I'm not sure if it's worth putting.

Volunteer Work

I volunteer at a local library for 2 hours weekly and have been for a year. Nothing significant, but shows some community work.

**Honors and Awards:**

2x team first places at State-level math competitions

1x team second place at a lesser-known national math competition

1x individual 5th place at the same lesser-known national math competition

AP Scholar w/ Distinction

National Merit Semifinalist (guaranteed) and possibly finalist

**With all of this in mind, does anyone have any last-minute tips or ECs that could boost my college app? Given all of this information, I'd like to apply to many of the T20s, but I believe that my target is something like Purdue CS or Penn State Schreyers.

I’m creating my schedule for next year (my senior year) and I want to fill it with APs. I know there are a lot of people who say to chill your senior year and not stress yourself out, which is valid, but I’m up for the challenge. My school doesn’t let us take APs freshman and sophomore year, which sucks because I want to go to a competitive school. I took AP Lang this year, and there were complications when I tried to sign up for APUSH and AP Pre-Calc so AP Lang has been my only AP class. I was wondering how important/how much of a good idea you think it is to sign up for courses at a community college over the summer. 

So, a couple of questions for you guys:
Do you guys think it’ll help counteract what I’ve missed out on thus far?

How much of a difference in the admissions process could it potentially make?

If I take biology or something in the sciences, would admissions officers count that as a fourth year of a science?

Are APs and college courses weighed the same? Is one better than the other?

I did not go through a traditional recruiting process because I am a coxswain. I am additionally waitlisted at my dream school (which I regret not EDing to at this point). 

I know there is nothing I really can do other than love VT and commit (and I really DO like it, however I know people from my school going who only put in at MOST half of the effort as me and cheat in literally every class, so it just feels like I could’ve put in so much less effort) but part of me is always going to wish I could have gone to one of my 6 waitlist schools and continue rowing competitively. 

It’s also a bit disheartening because I feel like I put in so much effort in HS (academically and athletically and with my part time job that my parents force me to have) yet still not enough. It’s like I was enough for my safeties &amp; one target but not good enough for the top schools, so I’ve just been thrown into the waitlist limbo at ALL of my targets and 3 T20s.

I’ll start off with what I want to do in life. I’ve wanted to be a neurosurgeon since 3rd grade because of my little sister having to have an operation at 3 months old, but lately I’ve been contemplating whether I want to do that or try for anesthesiologist, due to schedule severity and family time. Regardless, I know I will be going to med school after undergrad.
Next, here are my top options, in order of preference.
-Seton Hall
I haven’t yet got my financial aid grants back from them, but I have received around 160k in scholarships from them so far. The factor making this my top choice is their B.S./M.D. program which I have been admitted to.
-Bates
Grants have made total cost around 25k a year, and I enjoyed the community and advising when I visited. The only problem with this is they don’t have a nursing program near the area, which my gf of over a few years is going into and would like to be near each other.
-CU Denver
They have an Anesthesiology major for graduates, and the total cost of this would be the cheapest. However, my family is moving to the east from ND once I graduate, and I would like to be near them. Still a top choice.
Other acceptances are MSU Bozeman, Penn State, Baylor, MCPHS. (Not really considering)

then i caught up with a friend who went to a a really fancy private school, and we were talking about it. he had friends with low Cs that got into Harvard and Yale and all those. 

The whole time we were so sure we'd get in because surely the elitism must be exaggerated. but it's not. connections are what get people into those places, as is money.",2024-04-24 16:27:03

If so I would 100% recommend Princeton. UPitt’s BSMD program has very stringent GPA requirements, and if you are unable to meet them you’ll be completely boned. (UPitt grads have a median salary of $62k 4 years after graduation.) 

If you go to Princeton, you would always have the option to drop out of the pre-med track and still be very well-positioned for a successful career; 4 years after graduation, Princeton grads have a median salary of $110k.

*Tons* of very high-achieving students realize that medicine isn’t the right path for them during undergrad. Aiming for med school is a great goal, but imo you should always have a backup plan - and I’d say an inexpensive degree from the #1 school in the country is a pretty dang solid backup.",2024-04-24 16:33:37

* In Boston
* Good research opportunities
* Co-ops (can get work experience in college)
* In the honors program
* Easy to go abroad, even in the summer or during breaks

* A good business school
* Cheaper than Northeastern

- McGill (faculty of arts) Canadian OOS tuition because of the Quebec-France agreement, so like 8k Euros per year without factoring in living costs. It’s in Montreal, which is a city I really like, but it’s not in the US and I don’t know why but that kind of keeps gnawing at the back of my mind.

- GWU (Elliott) got a 20k merit scholarship, so the tuition and rooming comes down to like 60k a year. It’s in DC, which I absolutely adore. I less adore the lack of a “real” campus (I find that having nice old traditional buildings is really enjoyable, the architecture of a campus does play a role in how much I enjoy it). I’m also a bit miffed by it being right next to Georgetown (who rejected me), which I feel would be a constant reminder of my failure to get Georgetown. I toured both GWU and McGill and I had better vibes from McGill as a school, but I think I slightly preferred DC as a city.

- Emory. I got no financial aid and would be paying in full. Honestly this is the choice that I think makes the least sense but somehow I can’t remove it from my brain. I like the look of the campus (haven’t visited it though), and Atlanta seems to have a nice climate. It’s also in the US. Another bonus is it seems to be highly ranked (correct me if I’m wrong), so I feel I’d be proud of saying I go there.

- Middlebury. By far the most expensive option, 87k total per year. My high school counselor keeps telling me to go there, but I’m just not sure. It has a nice campus, but I want some access to a major city, and kind of don’t want to be lost in the middle of nowhere. I was told it’s great for international affairs, but I mostly have seen it praised for linguistics. I’m already bilingual, so I don’t think I would need that. Beyond that it seems fairly well regarded. It’s also worth noting I got in as a feb, so I would have a different start to most people.

Concerning money issues, my family can afford sending me to any institution I ultimately choose, but let’s just say that paying less for tuition would be preferred. My rational body is telling me McGill; I like the campus and the city. But I keep having second thoughts. I guess I made a promise that I would return to the US for college when I left to live in France (I had previously lived 10 years in Silicon Valley, but was born near Paris), and Canada isn’t the US, although its Anglo Saxon and not too different culturally.

I guess I just would like any advice y’all could give me.

3622,t1_l13y5m3,1713994933.0,"I think you'd need to spend more time studying at Pomona than Cal. For example, students who've done the Pomona-Swarthmore exchange note that the workload of the two schools is roughly the same (although the cultures are little different), and Swarthmore is known as one of the most academically demanding colleges anywhere. Outside of a few areas like pre-med and CS, I think Cal doesn't seem to have an insane workload, at least among the many friends I know who went there.

Both places will offer a lot of social opportunities for those who seek them out. But I'd give Cal a small edge. Even considering the 5-C Consortium, Cal's sheer undergraduate size and easy access to the Bay Area ensures that you'll have more social opportunities. It also has a Greek system, which almost always promises some parties.

I'm not trying to talk you out of going to Pomona though. It's probably what I'd choose if I had to do it allover again because I like the laidback intellectualism and liberal arts approach. But if I wanted less work and more social life, I'd pick Cal out of the two, and I'd pick UCLA over both if it were an option.

My guess is that, for purposes of admission, they love those who champion certain causes. They’ll just change their tune once the students they admit start championing those causes as college students.

Where do professors fit into all of this, considering they tend to lean left and openly support certain causes?

PROS: Scholarship covers full cost of attendance, laptop, and research stipend. With only 40 kids from my year receiving the full ride, I’d have an instant family. Financial freedom is amazing: I could do research, invest the money not spent on college, do whatever I want after undergrad. 

CONS: Fully STEM focused school and body. I feel like I’d constantly be stressed since I’ve never been ‘STEM smart’ and would spend a LOT of time studying.

As of April 23 at 9:30 pm ET, only four universities in the UK had no availability for Americans for Fall 2024 (Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College, LSE). Here are the more well-known universities that still have availability, according to UCAS.

I’ve also included the QS Global Rankings, which focus on sustainability, research output, and employability, not rejection or yield rates. I’m not necessarily endorsing these, but go to provide some measure of employability and reputation.

Oh, and I'm mentioning whether or not they have CS as a major, because five minutes of here or r/chanceme makes me think everyone wants to study CS.

University College London (Global #9) - 160; That UCL has any at all is shocking on levels that I cannot explain; it’s as if Yale or Berkeley still had spots available.  That said, plenty of good stuff here (not that Egyptology isn’t good stuff), but it’s a lot of joint honours with a modern language. If modern languages aren’t your thing, they’ve got a number of science and humanities focused options still available, too.

Edinburgh (Global #22) - 267; with Computer Science and Electronics as a possibility. Not surprising, but indicative of Edinburgh trying to get as much international attention as possible. Remember you can change your degree option at certain Scottish universities (Edinburgh, Glasgow, and St. Andrews among them).

Manchester (Global #32) - 421; Computer Science is still available. They will likely still have spots later this summer.

Kings College London (Global # 40) - 86; This one surprised me almost as much as UCL. Artificial Intelligence, War Studies, and Liberal Arts are still accepting applications. I didn’t expect them to have options at this point, because historically they play a bit closer to the chest than UCL.

Bristol (Global #55) - 238, with some in data science and similar subjects.

Warwick (Global #67) - 28; I’m surprised they still have spots. There are some gems here, like the joint honours degree of “Theatre and Performance Studies with Global Sustainable Development.” In all seriousness, a great choice for a more conservative kid with an eye to international relations, depending on the course.

Leeds (Global #75) - 251, with courses all over the place. CS is available

Glasgow (Global #76) - 708; with plenty of options in Computing Science (their term) and Business

Durham (Global #78) - 105, including both options in Computer Science and their popular Liberal Arts degree.

Southampton (Global #81) - 342, with courses in computer science. I know it’s not as popular in the US, but I have a student here now and she loves it.

Birmingham (Global #84) - 265; and yes, there’s computer science.

St. Andrews (Global #95) - 5; Bear in mind that St. Andrews has a relatively short list of options, and it’s a wonder any of them are still open. That said, 40% of St. Andrews students transfer to another degree field, or add a joint honours subject, so Earth Science can lead to Computer Science, and Modern Languages or Art History can lead to International Relations (and very often do).

Nottingham (Global #100) - 294, with offerings across CS

Sheffield (Global #104) - 242; A ton in computer science and just about everything else. Was recently named one of the best cities in the UK to be a student

Newcastle (Global #110) - 153; with options in Computer Science. Thomas Day was on my panel two weeks ago and indicated that as long as its not medicine, Newcastle still likely has options that would fit.

The number indicated is the number of degree options that are seeking students, not the number of slots still available. Additionally, a number of foundation years remain open for American applications.

Additionally, Brunel University and the University of Central Lancashire are accepting Americans into their medical schools for the fall. I have no idea if they are waiving due to the point of the year; Brunel typically makes it optional, but highly recommended.

Finally, this doesn’t count the dozen or so Australian, Canadian, or Irish universities that are still accepting applications from Americans. For example, Melbourne University (ranked #14) is accepting applications for everything except fine and performing arts.",2024-04-24 18:41:49

I got a full ride to both so financially it doesn’t matter which one I choose.

Half the people I know say Umich, other half says UCSB and I’m on the fence so I’d like some help deciding. 

UCSB Pre-Econ and Accounting 

Pros:
-Weather. Beautiful weather all year around. 
-The campus is literally on the beach
-Vibrate social life and everyone was super cool when I visited. 
-I’m going to Econ and Accounting and UCSB is a target school for the Big4
-The QOL seems really good there. Everyone I saw seemed very happy.

Cons:
-Outside of school expenses, the cost of living in SB is crazy high. 
-The administration doesn’t seem super well put together. There were several mistakes on their end when processing my admissions app/housing app and whenever I called in with questions I always got different answers and it was confusing.
-all they have for housing atm is double rooms and I’m not super excited about that. This one is more nitpicky and not a huge deal. 
-They have a weeder course to get into Econ and it’s notorious for the amount of people who fail out and have to change their major. I’m a little nervous about that. 

Umich Econ LSA

Pros:

-Big college football culture. I love watching sports so this is a big plus for me. 
-they gave me in state tuition because of being a veteran
-Ann Arbor seems like a really cool place to live
-the admin that I’ve worked with have been a dream. Super responsive, helpful, and knowledgeable. 
-more internship/job opportunities 
-more things to do in general

Cons:
-I’m from Cali but lived in Great Lakes, Il for a while and the weather is pretty brutal. 
-transfer housing is not guaranteed and the apartments within walking distance of the campus are expensive
-I’d be a little farther from home than I’d like. 

I’m sure there’s been a thousand of th we posts but I’m genuinely torn between them since they’re both great schools and seems like they’d be amazing to go to.

I think a schedule that's rigorous enough for you to get mostly As with one A- or B+ is a good balance (so around a 3.9 UW).

[https://www.peakframeworks.com/post/ib-target-schools](https://www.peakframeworks.com/post/ib-target-schools)

I then cross-referenced each school (that had any) with its number of enrolled non-sponsored NMFs:

[https://www.nationalmerit.org/s/1758/images/gid2/editor\_documents/annual\_report.pdf?gid=2&amp;pgid=61](https://www.nationalmerit.org/s/1758/images/gid2/editor_documents/annual_report.pdf?gid=2&amp;pgid=61)

I chose to use non-sponsored (i.e. not sponsored by the school) since some schools sponsor and some don't.  The set of non-sponsored scholars are those who either won one of the 2500 NMC awards, or who won one of the corporate sponsored awards.

I then divided each school's total elite IB hires by its total of non-sponsored NMFs.  The idea here is that it's not necessarily meaningful to express total elite IB hires as a function of the entire student body size, since these schools vary (widely) in selectivity.  What we might like to know is the total # of students at each school who are high-achievers.  Non-sponsored NMFs is the best proxy stat I could find for that.

Note:  in order for a student to be hired at an elite IB firm he or she must first be \*interested\* in such a job, and some schools enroll more students who even have IB as a goal.  Schools where the business/economics programs are significantly more competitive than the school as a whole will also look good here (e.g. Indiana).

First, some notable schools that didn't show up at all in the list of schools with elite IB hires:

3728,t3_1ccd9u3,1714002110.0,"Hey everyone, I’m a high school senior hit with the classic dilemma of whether to choose an OOS school or my in state school.

UW is my dream school and has been for a while. I had the chance to visit it recently, and it was absolutely amazing. I fell in love with Seattle and the vibes on campus, and I really felt like I could make it my home for the next four years. Plus, they’re well ranked and their public health program is great. I was admitted pre public health and offered their $4200 purple and gold scholarship which doesn’t make a dent into their $42,000 tuition, and I’m expecting no need-based financial aid since my family makes around $150k a year. 

UNLV is my in-state school, plus I live in Las Vegas and would most likely be commuting (no housing costs). I was offered lots of scholarship money from merit, particularly from National merit (UNLV gives $10k), and the other NV in-state scholarships (UNLV signature, millennium scholarship). Essentially, UNLV would be refunding me thousands of dollars a year, so it seems like the obvious choice, right?

I guess I’m just having trouble coping with having to let go of UW because I had the misfortune of being born in a different state. I know UNLV is a great research school and that there’s a lot of opportunities in store for me, but I really dislike the campus. There’s no community (from what I’ve heard) due to it being a commuter school, and there’s nothing to do around it because the area is bad. Obviously I have a car, but I don’t really like driving, and I wish I lived somewhere with actual public transit.

If anyone could provide me with some personal anecdotes to hopefully help me feel better about the situation, it would be much appreciated. 

For some extra info, I got waitlisted from UCLA, which has really been a dream for me although I knew it was a reach. My parents said if I got in off the waitlist, they’d consider sending me and paying for it, but it’s just tough to justify those OOS costs, for both UW and UCLA. I would absolutely love UW, and we COULD pay for it, but it would be a strain, and I feel like it’s just not worth it.",2024-04-24 19:41:50

3730,t1_l14hcjd,1714002243.0,"What you will hear from colleges is ""take the most rigorous option available to you"".  My daughter did that, switching from a regular track into an honors track at 11th grade (an uncommon move at her school, but she wasn't being challenged in her math classes.)  It went... not well.  She ended the year with a B- when she'd been managing As before and when every other grade on her report card was an A or higher. It hurt her GPA and I do think that played a real factor in her having fewer acceptances. It was tough on her confidence as well. In the end I think she came out of the process more resilient and able to deal with failure, and that teacher made one of his few offers of recommendation letters to her because he was impressed with how she persisted, but if we had the choice to do it all over again I think we would have encouraged her to stay where she was successful, take the higher GPA, and save the challenge for college.

It's a bit more complicated for you-- dropping from a more rigorous path to a less rigorous path won't look great, but if you are increasing your rigor in your other classes,  it may be worth it, particular y for a foreign language requirement that doesn't tie in to your college goals.",2024-04-24 19:44:03

Cost is not a factor but it is very similar for both schools (In state for Davis vs out of state for Purdue). I hope to go straight into the industry after undergrad so job opportunities and recruitment is a big factor for me.

**UC Davis**

Davis Pros:

* Close to home
* Nice campus with warm weather
* In-state
* Safe college town
* Close to the silicon valley so good potential for jobs
* Nice dorms

Davis Cons:

* CS program doesn't seem as appealing
* Resources and Career Fairs seem subpar compared to Purdue
* Don't really know anyone going (could be a good or bad thing)
* Not ranked as high as Purdue for CS (Davis is tied for 27th while Purdue is tied for 18th)

**Purdue**

Purdue Pros:

* Great career fairs and on campus recruitment
* Haven't been to campus yet but the campus and gym on campus are really nice
* Could double major in CS + AI or CS + Data Science
* Know a lot of people going so I won't be depressed or anything
* Very highly regarded for Computer Science

Purdue Cons:

* Far from home and traveling there is a pain (2-3 hour bus rides from campus to airport and vice versa)
* COLD. Being from California I'm not sure if I would adjust well.
* Surrounding area is not amazing and from what I've heard the location isn't as great for CS jobs and opportunities

  
I'm visiting Purdue soon, so I will have more of a feel for a campus after then. But this is the information I have right now, and I am leaning towards Purdue. Any insight is appreciated and please let me know if I'm missing something or if I am wrong about something!

Pros
•	⁠Got accepted into Ross BBA program 
•	⁠Regarded as a good school for finance  
•	⁠D1 sports  
•	Get to go away from home and explore
 
Cons
•Estimated financial aid offer from them is saying $3000 a year  w/o taking out any subsidized loans.   This might also go up in the following years due to my parents getting an increase in income 
•	⁠10 hour drive from home 
. All family friends and relatives are saying stay home for undergrad

City college:

Pros
•	⁠I will either have a full ride or free tuition while getting around $10,000 a year from a scholarship 
•	⁠Will become the favorite child if I stay 
•	⁠Close to home

Cons
•	⁠School has no prestige at all and isn’t known for academics 
•	Isn’t d1 so no sports or anything like that

When applications came back, aside from a waitlist at Dartmouth and Emory, I didn’t get into any ivies, or my second tier (BC, UVA, Etc.). 

I will now be attending a large state school on National Merit Scholarship.  I’m nervous that it will be too conservative/not a good fit for me, even though some parts excite me. And honestly, I’ve always had my heart set on a t25. I’m open to trying out this state school, but a part of me wants to try again, and I think I can do it.

So my question is this: if I decide I want to try again to transfer to an Ivy, or another better school, is there anything I can do to improve my chances while in college/ the summer? I know some have increased transfer chances, and I’m hoping that test optional policies going away could help me but I’m wondering if anyone has any experience/advice with this.

I feel like I can do this because my brother with very similar stats just got into brown, but I’m not sure how transfer vs normal admittance plays into that.

So overall I had a few questions, I’m hoping people could answer:

If I do pursue this avenue should I consult with a college application coach, or are those wastes of money/ resources?

 And then should I send out 8-10 apps or focus on 2-3 schools?

3850,t3_1ccg1k8,1714009998.0,"I'm currently deciding between cornell and umd (in state). cornell costs \~60k more per year, but I'm very grateful that my family can afford either and they encouraged me not to consider cost as a major factor. Cornell is obviously more prestigious, both overall and for my major (math), but after visiting both I just feel like I'd be happier at Maryland.

that being said, I don't think I'd hate cornell -  I do think I'll be able to find my people there, and if it comes down to it, I think I can just suck it up for 4 years. also, if I were to pick cornell, I don't know if I'd be able to have any regrets as long as I succeed academically, no matter how unhappy I might feel. however, if I choose umd,  I'm scared I'll regret passing up on cornell and its opportunities, but then again I don't want to make my decision out of fear.

I know cornell makes more sense and that it's probably the smarter decision in this case, but I try and I try to feel excited about it the way I feel excited about umd and I just can't.

* Gtown - Government (The College) 
* Umich - ??? (LSA) 
* Rutgers - Accounting (Business School)

**Cost:** Georgetown and UMich are the same (Gtown like slightly more). Rutgers is significantly cheaper because of instate tuition, but i’m grateful to say cost isn’t the deciding factor of my decision!

**Georgetown**

*Gtown Pros:*

* DC is good for internships/future jobs (also I like museums) 
* More personalized learning (smaller school) 
* Teachers/classes + speakers seem most interesting 
* The name!!

*Gtown Cons:*

* Campus/Facilities (feels like they’re using the “traditional/old” appeal just so they won’t fix the campus…do they clean bathrooms often? how often do rats appear…Is food good?) 
* Rats (Deserves its own category) 
* Expensive area to live in 
* Club exclusivity

**University of Michigan**

*Umich Pros:*

* Campus/Facilities are really gorgeous!! (and clean from what i saw at least…and the food was nice!) 
* School spirit seems like fun 
* I liked the research opportunities &amp; help centers 
* The name (tho is gtown more reputable?)

*Umich Cons:*

* Seems like academically-wise umich is only known for engineering or business (i’m in lsa…) 
* Far from home 
* Not in major city

**Rutgers**

*Rutgers Pros* 

* Facilities and campus are pretty good (better than Gtown I think) 
* Close to home (I can do laundry)

*Rutgers Cons* 

* After living in NJ my entire life and saying i wouldn’t go here…it hurts the pride a little lol (I know Rutgers is a good school, but then why did I try so hard in high school?)
* Also I think I wouldn't be academically challenged 
* I dont want to do accounting (accounting the name of the school doesn't rlly matter)

**The dilemma:**

* **Georgetown seems like it would interest me academically** and have good job opportunities. 
* **Umich campus &amp; life outside academics is really nice** tho im not a big party person (and academics are good too! but maybe not for my academic interests?) 
* **Rutgers is cheap**, and if I go to law school, I would like to save a bit for undergrad (though $ isn’t the deciding factor) and there’s grade inflation.

I don’t really know for sure what I want to do with my life. Right now law seems like what I’m aiming for, but I don't know if that will be the case in a year let alone four more. If I go into law, would the opportunities (ex: internships, teacher recs) of a prestigious undergrad like Gtown give me an advantage over Rutgers? **Does Rutgers, Gtown, or Umich have the grade inflation I would need for a higher GPA?** 

Additionally, if I don't want law school, I don't want to be stuck with a useless undergrad degree. (useless, meaning I cant find a job).

However, UMich was also very impressive (I vibed). I’m not really sure what I would study in LSA, but I can see myself living on the campus. **If I went to UMich I would consider transferring** **schools** or getting a dual degree with engineering. I've always loved humanities, but STEM isn't the end of the world for me.

3872,t3_1ccgf68,1714011076.0,"May 1, the deadline to enroll in a college is around the corner, and I still haven't chosen the college I will be attending for my Freshman year of college... This college cycle has been rough, and, unfortunately, I wasn't able to make it to any of the schools I wanted to go to... None of my reaches... Not even a single one of my targets... I was able to get into four schools, though:

1 - UCONN (Finance)  
2 - Wisconsin-Madison (Finance)  
3 - Northeastern (Finance)  
4 - Colgate (Quantitative Economics)

I was wondering which college I should choose, knowing that I am going to try to transfer out after my Freshman year. Most people have told me that **Colgate** is the best option on the table, while a few said Northeastern. I just want to know which college is the most prestigious that AO's would respect in my transfer application, and would give me the best shot at making any of these:  


* University of Pennsylvania
* Duke University
* Cornell University
* Northwestern University
* Harvard University
* Yale University
* Princeton University
* Stanford University
* Massachusetts Institute of Technology
* Columbia University
* Dartmouth University
* Brown University
* New York University - Stern
* Amherst College
* Vanderbilt University
* Georgetown University
* Carnegie Mellon University
* University of Southern California
* Washington University - St. Louis
* Emory University
* University of Michigan
* University of California - Berkeley
* University of California - Los Angeles
* University of Virginia

Again, I just want to know which college to which I've been accepted (UCONN, Wisconsin, Northeastern, or Colgate) is the most prestigious that AOs would respect in my transfer application and would give me the best shot next year in my transfer application process.

Intended major: **biochem** (might switch to other bio related field)

Intended career: Genuinely don't know (maybe pharmacy or some type of lab work or medical field)

**University of California San Diego!!**

UCSD Pros:

* **highly ranked/funded research institution (good for STEM major)**
* San diego is great biotech hub (not exactly biochem though and I don't plan on moving to San Diego anytime close to after i graduate but could still be good for potential internships)
* Beautiful campus + weather
* Safe surrounding area with a lot to visit/see (beaches, restaurants, etc)

* I have family nearby who are down to drive me/take me places 
* my dream to live in california since I was little

UCSD Cons:

* **full oos tuition (estimated 74k+ a year) + travel expenses. my parents say not to worry abt it but its still an insane cost** 
* capped majors (don't know if imma stick with biochem but capped majors make it impossible to switch into things like engineering, DS, or CS)

I am in between Umass Amherst and Mount Holyoke College. Before you say the two aren’t comparable, hear me out. 

I applied as undecided at MoHo and to the arts and humanities exploratory track at Umass. 

My estimated cost at MH was roughly 12k a year, which includes everything from a dining plan to room and board. At Umass, my yearly cost would be about 9.5k without room and board (commuting). I live about 30 minutes from Umass so I don’t think it would be worth it to dorm there for a significantly higher price, and I know that they have had trouble fitting all they’re students into their dorms in the past. 

I have been planning on commuting to college for almost my entire high school career, but after reviewing my options I am no longer so sure if thats he best thing for me. Mount Holyoke is a better overall deal as the starting price was over 80k and I was able to cut that price down significantly with merit aid, grants, and scholarships.

Only you know how deep rooted and sustainable your desire to be a doctor is. I'd be honest with yourself, and make your choice. If it's still 100% and not 80ish, Pitt all the way. Otherwise, Princeton (or Vandy if you love the culture, location, etc)",2024-04-24 23:44:40

Berkeley admitted only 29% of transfer applicants, and 91% were from California Community Colleges.

19 is average age. Most US students are 17-18 when they start college.

I think only if you took college leveled courses or AP/IB credits, you would be able to skip classes. Else, see if you are able to test out of some classes. 

If you are looking to stay in Florida, some schools that come to mind are University of Florida, Florida State University, and University of Miami. A lot of schools offer generous financial aid for low income families, so don't worry about that too much. Try applying to 3-10 schools.

Over summer, start looking for colleges would fit you well. Most colleges use CommonApp or Coalition as their application system. They open in August and most schools have a deadline after October. In the application, you need high school transcript, letters of recommendation, personal statement, list of activities you did in high school, and some school specific essays such as Why this school/Why this major.

If you apply early then results come around December. Regular decisions come around March. 

After applications/over winter break, look at financial aid stuff and probably apply early January. Fafsa is probably key for you.

4028,t3_1ccjcot,1714020410.0,"Hey, so basically I appealed to UC San Diego because I qualified as a national finalist in this satellite-related competition before the deadline. I applied as an aerospace engineering major so it's pretty well-suited. The only issue now is that since the application deadline, I actually won the competition. So now I'm wondering if there's a way that I can send UCSD an update or something because I think ""winner"" sounds a lot better than just finalist, again because this competition is so closely related to my major.   
  
While I'm at it, if there's a chance I could maybe send like a late appeal or something to other schools as well? Schools that I originally hadn't appealed to but already missed the deadline. I heard from a friend that some people just write a letter to the dean directly, but I'm not sure if that actually works or if it's a waste of time. 

I'm currently torn between UC Irvine and Purdue West Lafayette, and that's a tough decision because UCI is not nearly as good of an engineering school, and Purdue might not have the ""connections"" or whatever for an aerospace career + not that desirable of a location. UCSD seems to solve all my requirements, being both a more prestigious school than UCI (I think Purdue and SD are close enough in ranking that it's negligible) and a better location for personal reasons, so I'd really like to maximize my chances.

TLDR; Was a finalist in a major-related national competition when the appeal deadline for UCSD closed, but I just won it so please lmk if there's a way for me to update UCSD and increase the chances of them overturning my decision. Thanks",2024-04-25 00:46:50

1- Colleges look at what was available to you. You/counselor can explain that your school had this policy and you took as many advanced courses as possible. 

2-In terms of class, it looks good since you would be doing more rigorous coursework. In terms of AP credit, I dont think they care.

I enrolled in a Japanese university for 4 years as a sociology student and hate it. I want to do international business and I think I want to transfer to another school. But I have a 2.8 GPA (my school makes me take 10 classes per semester, I’ve already taken 20 classes🥲) and can’t afford super high tuition like there is in America. And I just started my second year of college because school starts in April here.

I wanted to transfer to Canada because I heard that it’s cheaper than the US, plus I like learning French so that’s a plus. My uni in Japan lets me transfer out too.

**Boston University (BU):**

Pros:

1. Boston is my dream city, especially as a Physics student, with its abundance of STEM professionals and companies offering fantastic opportunities.
2. Being in Boston means access to numerous STEM-focused companies and research institutions, potentially providing valuable internships and networking opportunities.
3. BU offers a strong overall academic environment, even though I haven't received financial aid.
4. The vibrant culture and diverse community of Boston could enhance my college experience beyond academics.

Cons:

1. Unfortunately, BU hasn't offered me any financial aid, resulting in a significantly higher cost of attendance. This could mean taking on substantial student loan debt.
2. With no financial aid, the total cost of attendance at BU may strain my finances and my family's resources.
3. While Boston is attractive for STEM opportunities, the high cost of living could offset some of the benefits.

**University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC):**

Pros:

1. UIUC's Physics program, especially Engineering Physics, is highly regarded and ranked among the top 10 in the country, providing a strong academic foundation.
2. Despite receiving limited financial aid, the total cost of attendance at UIUC is lower compared to BU, potentially resulting in less student loan debt.
3. Access to a diverse range of STEM resources, research facilities, and a supportive academic community within the university.
4. Urbana-Champaign offers a lower cost of living compared to Boston, which could make it more financially feasible in the long run.

Cons:

1. Urbana-Champaign may not offer the same level of excitement or opportunities as Boston, especially in terms of vibrant city life and access to STEM industries.
2. While UIUC's Physics program is strong, it may not have the same concentration of STEM companies and networking opportunities as Boston.
3. Choosing UIUC means foregoing my dream of living in Boston, which could impact my overall college experience and future career prospects if the location is a significant factor for me.",2024-04-25 01:06:52

Top colleges are looking for you to challenge yourself academically and demonstrate you’re able to handle the work. They are also looking at your senior year and want to see you’re still challenging yourself there. Since you only started taking AP’s as a junior and you’re not planning to take any as a senior, it may be hard to show off your academic side in comparison to the competition.

That being said, it does sound like you have a lot of great EC’s. That won’t necessarily make up for the academics, but I always think it’s worth giving it a shot.

I am a community college (Political Science) student located in the Sacramento metro area. Recently I've been accepted to every single school I've applied to transfer to (yay!) while this is great it's left kind of stressed about which school to pick. So far I've narrowed it down to two. UC Davis and UC San Diego.

**UC Davis**

**Pros:**

* Close to home, so moving wouldn't be hard.
* Close to my pet bird so I wouldn't feel too bad about potentially leaving without her.
* In-between both Sacramento and the Bay Area which opens up a lot of potential career opportunities after graduating.
* Campus looks really nice.
* Walkable.
* Supposedly good campus culture. From what I've heard it's very humble and relaxed.
* Political Science program is 30th in the nation and 6th in the state. So I'm most likely getting a solid education.
* Decent bus/transit system from what I've heard.

**Cons:**

* The weather. Super cold winters and really hot summers.
* Too familiar. Having lived in the Sac Valley for most of my life I'm kind of hoping for something a bit different. From what I've seen, Davis looks like the town I grew up in that just happens to be located near a great university.
* Too rural? I don't quite know how to explain this one. It's kind of like the above con. Basically, I've lived in an exurb for most of my life already, and I can't say that I'm super excited to be moving to another exurb/suburb/small city.
* Unsure if I would fit in. For lack of a better term, I'm a hipster. I like alternative/artsy people and I'm not super sure if Davis has that or if I would fit in.
* Housing could be a challenge.

**UC San Diego**

**Pros:**

* Far away. I'd really get a chance to establish my independence and start fresh in a new place.
* Political Science program is ranked 8th in the nation! I would be getting some of the best education in the country.
* Weather is pretty good, plus the ocean is close by.
* Campus looks great (I got into Earl Warren College btw if that's important).
* Located in a major city so I get to be in both a super urban environment and have a lot of potential career opportunities.
* Seemingly excellent public transportation system, at least, compared to Sac.
* Super diverse.

**Cons:**

* Risky. Since it's super far away from home, I would be taking a huge risk packing up my life and moving it down there. I would also need to ensure that I have sustainable income and housing before even packing my first bag.
* Expensive housing. Since San Diego is a popular city, and in California, housing is going to be a challenge. I'm cool with roommates but it would really need to be a perfect fit.
* Competitive environment. I get stressed pretty frequently, and the rigorous academic curriculum UCSD is known for might not go over well for me.

These are all of the pros and cons I can think of for both schools. I've been debating this choice in my head ever since I heard back from both schools, and I haven't been able to make a decision. If this sub could help me make up my mind, I would greatly appreciate it. Hopefully I've included any and all relevant information.",2024-04-25 01:50:54

**Transfer to CS + X (UIUC)**

Since I expect to get proficiency credit for CS 124 and MATH 241, I'd need to get an A- in CS 173 and CS 225, a B- in MATH 347, and maintain a 3.67 overall GPA to transfer into Math &amp; CS. From my conversations with UIUC advisors, getting class enrollment won't be an issue, and I'll be guaranteed a transfer if I get the necessary grades. If I can't transfer to CS + X, I can transfer to Computer Engineering, guaranteed. I hope to complete all transfers by the end of my third semester. I feel like these transfer requirements are very doable, and Computer Engineering is a great fallback option also.

**Research**

When I visited Purdue, it seemed like getting research is a lot easier for Freshmen, especially through the Datamines LLC. Comparatively, at UUIC, it seemed like the professors were more accomplished, but it would be much harder to get research in my freshman year. Strong research opportunities are very important to me since I'm potentially considering getting a PhD.

**Job Opportunities**

From what I've gathered, UIUC's career fairs are larger and more prominent companies come there. For example, opening doors to quant firms and certain selective tech companies. Although I'm not currently hoping to become a quant, I don't want to close any potential doors before I know what I truly want to pursue. Also, I feel like the UIUC name is more prominent within the CS field and could be beneficial throughout my early career.

**Clubs**

When I visited both schools, I talked with members of the clubs I'm interested in. At Purdue, I really connected with the club culture, the work of the specific clubs, and the members' passion for their subteams. At UIUC, I didn't have the same experience. I didn't connect as much with the specific clubs, and it seemed like there wasn't as strong of a club culture. This could be a biased viewpoint based on the select few clubs I saw though.

**Social Life**

Obviously, UIUC is a massive, expansive party school. On the other hand, Purdue seems quieter, with less to do in the surrounding area/college town. I do prefer UIUC in this aspect.

**Conclusion**

I'd love to hear all of your advice and recommendations as I make my college decision. Also, I was hoping that you guys could corroborate some of my beliefs or squash any mistruths.",2024-04-25 02:42:23

For some people, connections is a huge part of why they go to college. You evaluate how 'influenced' you are byyour environment. Some are self-driven, some are motivated by others. Being around people in Cornell who've been rigorously screened will influence you in a different way vs people in UMD (in general, at the end of the day its obviously about who you choose to surround yourself with when you're there, just the pool will be different). Sure both Cornell and UMD is a prestigious university and both places will offer a great education but I think you need to find the balance between cost and 'Ivy League' connections. I have friends at Cornell who really enjoy the Greek life there and cannot imagine themself anywhere else.

Keep in mind that in the eyes of your parents, college has the highest ROI. If your family is very wealthy and are comfortable with spending 240k more then great. Your family's opportunity cost for 240k is very different from others undoubtedly.

  
Keep talking with your family. Visit the university if you haven't.

Two is that UC Davis School of Medicine is heavily biased toward applicants who commit to that region.

Intended major:  
UCSB: Pre-Economics &amp; Accounting

UCSD: Business Economics

UCR: Business Administration (Finance or Accounting)

UCSB Pros:

* Closer to home (280 miles)
* I heard it was a beautiful campus (will be touring it next month to find out!!)
* ""Party school""
* Someone told me that big 4 companies directly recruit here
* I ""know"" a few people here (not that close)

BC Cons:

* It's a ""towny"" area, even if I drive to the nearby cities
* Heard there weren't many ""good"" asian restaurants (ex. sushi &amp; kbbq)
* The dorms aren't that nice and no singles (will probably get an apartment though)

**UC San Diego**

UCSD Pros:

* City like
* Nicer dorms with singles (will probably get an apartment though)
* Better food options around SD than SB that fit my preferences
* A few of my good friends go here

UCSD Cons:

* Further away from home (450 miles)
* ""Socially dead""

**UC Riverside**

UCR Pros:

* I've wanted to live and visit that part of socal 
* Better food and store options within a 60 mile radius (I don't mind driving 40 minutes to get ""better"" food)
* Received a $6,000 scholarship for the remaining two years
* A ton of my friends go to UCLA and UCI so I'll be hanging out with them pretty often

UCR Cons:

* People look down on the school
* I know no one that goes to this school",2024-04-25 03:48:24

4159,t3_1ccmhy8,1714032509.0,"Greetings to: Students, Faculty and Staff,

Recently, I've been pondering about going back to UCLA to finish my undergraduate degree. I did not finish completing my last couple classes (I believe it was 2-3 courses) that I needed in order to graduate. As I did not pass certain courses (one I failed twice) during the COVID era. This was primarily due to personal circumstances, in particular, mentally and financially as that time was extremely difficult for myself and many others.

I took a break from school overall as I failed courses during C session of Summer 2020. After a year of working back home to regain financial stability, I decided to attend my local community college as I finally wanted to go back to school and further my education. After some time away from UCLA, I wanted to study something else as my original plan was to use my undergraduate degree from UCLA to pursue higher education. However, my grades during my period at UCLA was not up to standards with many other applicants to the program I wanted to apply to after.

My mental health, financial situation, but also the entire world improved quite drastically after about a year from taking a break from classes. In the fall of 2021, I attended my local CC to earn credit for the pre-requisite courses in a major I wanted to pursue (a business transfer degree). I'd like to add, as I did not note earlier, that my major before I left UCLA was in the pre-med department. After attending my local CC for about three semesters, I decided to visit UCLA and ask the counselors if I could apply for readmission.

Around February of 2023, I visited UCLA and met with a counselor. Upon talking to an Academic Counselor or Advisor (I forget if its the same or which one I talked to exactly), they mentioned that I can definitely reapply for admission. However, the catch was that I would have a very unlikely chance of getting readmitted if I were to change my major to Business Economics. From what I remember the advisor telling me, the reasoning was since I had already attended 11 out of the 12 quarter(I took one off due to health reasons), that it would be very difficult to be readmitted as each student is typically allowed to be at UCLA for 12 quarters, and sometimes more if it is accepted by the school.

After a long consideration, I had high doubts that I would get readmitted. I thought that even if I did get readmitted based on my new major, I would highly unlikely to be allotted more time to complete my upper division courses due to the 12 quarter rule I'd been told about. Another factor was the costs of going back to UCLA, would require more money to be there than if I were to reapply at a nearby university to home.

I finally came to the conclusion that I would finish up my degree for transfer at CC and apply for new universities. Upon applying, I only applied for schools within the CSUs system and decided not to apply to UCs. Fast forward to admittance letters, I got admitted to attend at a CSU for the Fall of 2023.

Today, I am doing quite well in my studies. I got admitted to the major I wanted and currently am on pace to finishing in Spring of 2025. However, I have always wondered if I have the ability to go back and finish up my degree at UCLA. It will be either sometime in the future (a few years from now) or even directly after I finish up my degree at the CSU I am currently attending. I guess I can say that I don't want to leave it or anything unfinished, if I am able to go back and complete my degree at UCLA. I was curious as I would already have a undergraduate degree, with ""some"" GE requirements filled at the CSU I am attending from UCLA (just a handful as many classes did not fit the GE requirements at the CSU).

If students have a similar story, please let me know how it worked out in the end. And if you're part of the faculty and staff at UCLA, please let me know about my situation and if it is something I can pursue. I will definitely reach out to UCLA in the future, but wanted some insight before I make that decision to go back.

Thanks so much for reading! I hope you have a wonderful rest of your week. :)",2024-04-25 04:08:29

The only choice I have to make is regarding which science I take, these are the other APs I am taking: AP French, AP Macro and Microeconomics, AP Art, AP Lit, and AP BC Calc.

I'm a pretty strong student (97.3/100 GPA) and I think I could handle Physics if I REALLY put my mind to it, but the teacher at my school is infamous for not being a great instructor, and I am romanticizing chilling completely as a second semester senior since I've been grinding like crazy since freshman year.

Physics will give me more credit if I score well, but it's also not crazy important for architecture and I'm not sure I'll end up using it.

I like Physics and all, but IDK if I like it enough to put a ridiculous amount of work in. I also don't want to feel like I'm wasting my potential and being ""lazy"" by taking APES though.

Will it hurt my chances of getting into a top school if I choose APES instead of Physics C?

4166,t1_l167n1g,1714033335.0,"This came across my feed somehow and as someone who also strongly considered UMD as an in-state student 5y ago, I don't think you can really go wrong. Prioritize your mental (and physical) health first. However I do want to offer a counterpoint on money because so many people mention it. It looks like you're considering math with CS, and the average starting salaries for Cornell and UMD CS graduates are around $120k and $85k respectively. That's a pretty sizeable difference (with a large variance, some people are unemployed and at the tail end there are people who make $500k+ before bonus as a new grad in finance). I'm exposing myself as a nerd here but if you invest the difference at the same rate, solve the diffeq etc. it pays off in 10 years even if you don't get any raises or bonuses. 

To be fair, that's assuming you would be a median student at both schools, which might not be true. But even a pay difference of $15k will pretty much even out the starting amount by the time you retire. That said, most of my friends who went to UMD still did great and are making way above median because they sought out opportunities for themselves, but ""top"" schools definitely have better career fairs and more student-specific opportunities. Personally, while I eventually decided to pursue grad school, I only became sure I wanted to because of a first year internship opportunity available through an alumni program. 

Like others have said, college is also very personal and what you prioritize might be different, but for me the opportunity to explore and figure out what I wanted to do was invaluable. Although UMD is also a great school (especially for in state) with decent CS/math/engineering, I personally think I would've a harder time there and might not have felt confident enough to even consider grad school. Again though this is very personal and the ""returns"" are pretty hard to estimate so if you truly don't think you would be happy at Cornell, don't go. I have plenty of friends who went to UMD and have great jobs or grad program placements.

Edit: just to emphasize, it's unclear just how much the school you graduate from will increase your personal earning potential. From anecdotal experience though, it does help you get your foot into the door and saves you a ton of work and stress when you end up applying, so I think it's unlikely you'll ""waste"" the money. The true value for me was the increased optionality. Most people don't know where they'll end up at 18, and it's significantly easier to sample the possibilities at some schools compared to others just due to lower activation energy/opportunities appearing in your face.",2024-04-25 04:22:15

My biggest advice about LOCIs from reading a few is not to rehash your admissions file. You don't need to write another ""Why Us?"" essay, just update them, briefly reiterate your commitment and that you'd attend if you got off the waitlist, etc.

A2C has a resource on LOCIs, but short and sweet is better than several pages emphasizing small (in the big picture) accomplishments.

If you won some cool awards, share that with them. That you got to be valedictorian or salutatorian is pretty standard stuff that won't make a school of Barnard's caliber bat an eye.

4240,t1_l16lxuw,1714043220.0,"The amount of loans you’d need to take out for either option will be crippling.  Paying off $200,000 or more will genuinely destroy your life.

Before borrowing any money, Google a loan payment calculator and enter the total amount you’d need to borrow over the course of four years — PLUS add about ~15% to that amount to account for the interest that will accrue while you’re in school — to see how much your monthly payment would be for loans at 7% for a 10yr term.

https://www.bankrate.com/loans/loan-calculator/

Based on that, getting loans to fully cover $200,000 in loans will leave you $230,000 or so in debt by the time you graduate. Paying that off will cost you roughly $2,700 a month… every month… for ten years. That’s $32,400 a year.  Then, keep in mind that amount will be AFTER TAX dollars, so gross that amount up by like 15-20% to see how much you’d need to earn BEFORE taxes each month/year to pay off that loan.

That would mean that, before taxes, the first $39,000 or so you earn each year — FOR TEN YEARS — would go just to paying off your loans.

And even that ignores the opportunity cost of forgoing saving/investing that $39,000 a year… every year… for ten years.  As well as the compound growth of that money for the entirety of your adult life.  That’s millions of dollars lost out on.  The likelihood of earning enough incremental money to EVER break even in your lifetime is ZERO.

There’s lots of data out there that shows that people who graduate from college with more than $100,000 in debt are statistically more likely to…
- delay or never get married
- delay or never own their own home
- delay or never have children 
- delay or never retire

People love to tout rules of thumb about how much debt is Ok, how long it takes to pay it back, whether some debt is “good debt”, etc.  But when you do the math — and look at the practical implications — student loan debt is almost always a bad idea, and should be avoided if at all possible.",2024-04-25 07:07:00

As far as I can tell, it's roughly, these research universities:

Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Duke, Harvard, MIT, Northwestern, Princeton, Rice, Stanford, UPenn.

And these liberal arts colleges:

Amherst, Bowdoin, Davidson, Lafayette, Pomona, Soka, Swarthmore, Richmond, Wesleyan, Williams.

\[*Edit*: I should clarify that these seemed to be consensus picks from looking at a couple of online lists — I didn't check every school individually. Many schools are ""need-blind"", many even say that they ""meet financial need"", but this is a subset of them that meet financial need *without loans*. See comments below for other suggestions of schools that might fit these criteria.\] 

A lot of online lists as part of this Tulane is, but I think that's a misunderstanding of it's policy (or maybe I'm misunderstanding their policy). I think in practice Yale maybe could potentially be on this list, but they technically don't guarantee full demonstrated need without loans like the others on this list do. I'd have to look more closely at each school's policy to figure out if the online lists are just copying off of each other. 

I'm really surprised UChicago dropped off this list — I'm an alumnus, and they made a [big deal out of an anonymous $100 million dollar donation in 2007](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/uchicago-board-trustees-gift-launches-new-200-million-commitment-undergraduate-financial-aid%20from%20fulfilling%9D), that I think with matching funds got up to $200 million dollars. The donor, given the very UChicago nickname of ""Homer"", said he said he hoped his donation would make students ""graduate without the siren of debt distracting them from fulfilling unremunerative dreams.” The whole point of this donation, I thought, was to guarantee ""need-blind, loan-free education for students regardless of their economic circumstances"".",2024-04-25 07:36:58

4288,t3_1ccqn0i,1714047975.0,"Hello I am an international senior looking for college choice advice.
I am majoring in poli sci, possibly change my major to econ or business and eventually want to get an MBA or go to Law School. I think I’d want to be a consultant and when I go to college would search for internships related to that job. 
I recently got admitted to UCLA, Rice, Emory, Tufts, Purdue, BC, etc but eventually decided to choose btw Rice or Emory.
I’m thinking of trying to transfer to T25 schools that have relatively better chance for transfer students.
Now here are my questions.
1. Which university would give me a better chance to transfer as a poli sci major to T25 schools given that I get good grades and add up my ECs?
2. If I fail to transfer and decide to major on econ or business which school would give me a better chance of interning as an undergraduate at top consulting firms?
I personally am more towards Emory since honestly when T25 unis are looking Emory and Rice are not too different (though I know Rice is generally thought as more prestigious), and even if I get rejected to my target transfer schools I think that I’d have a better chance of getting a fine job at the SE in Emory. Also I heard that pre BBA at goizueta is quite good. Furthermore, I’d be able to apply for financial aid or merit scholarships on my second year (I didn’t apply for one on my initial resume because I heard that it significantally decreases the chance of acceptance for international students) unlike Rice which doesn’t provide additional scholarships to those who did not ask for one on their initial apply.
My parents are more towards Rice because it is more prestigious and higher ranked, and thus it would be comparably advantagious both when I apply for transfer to T25 schools and if I fail on that and have to graduate that school. I would be majoring in econ if I decide to go there since I heard that Rice economics is not bad. At least better than business major. Also my school consultant told them that Rice would be better.

Which school do you think would be better? Could you also tell the reason too?",2024-04-25 08:26:15

I think it really comes down to whether to not you want the bonding experience that comes with living on MoHo's small campus.  Personally I think it's invaluable, helping you build your sense of belonging as well as future professional connections.

In the grand scheme the extra 2.5k at MoHo is probably somewhat balanced out by your commuting costs and having to buy your own food at UMASS so they are pretty equal in a financial respect-- with MoHo maybe cheaper when food is factored in.

If it were me I'd go MoHo but I am also a grad of a SLAC so that experience is more familiar to me than what UMASS offers. 

Academically you get smaller classes, more personalized attention at MoHo, but less selection and variety than you'd get at UMASS.  Have you spent time with the course catalogs at each school, picking out a dozen or so classes you'd be excited to take your first few years?  I do think the much larger selection of curriculum at UMASS would be more interesting to me if I was undecided as you are.

You might be able to do some shifts during the two pre-clinical years, but impossible during the clinical years.  You would never be able to earn enough to pay for med school - you will probably have to borrow for that.  You would, however, have an excellent off-ramp into nursing, and maybe a NP or DNP degree, a much easier, shorter and cheaper path to playing doctor.

If you major in psych and do your premeds, you could very easily wind up with a degree that cannot earn you a living, while acquiring debt.

Take a look at your SAT score, which is predictive of what you might be able to get on the MCAT.  If your score was below 1300, I'd recommend you go for the BSN.  If it was over 1450 and you love science and do very well in it, took AP Chem/Bio/Physics and loved them and got 4 or 5 on the APs, then you have a chance of succeeding in becoming an MD.  You have to realize that something like 90% of the people who start college as premeds wind up never applying to med school, and of those who do, only a third actually get in.  So if your family is not wealthy enough to support you through all this, I would recommend going for the BSN.  The fact is that you can major in anything, and still wind up going to med school - so why not get a BSN, which sets you up for a decent life where you can support yourself and your kids, and still if you want med school, you can take the prereqs and study for the MCAT, do well, and get into med school.

There are more Asian students at Rutgers than white students. And that's not even counting the international students lol.

I think it’s true that medical schools frown on nurse applicants and have a lower acceptance rate but I wonder about the nuances of that data. Maybe it’s because they don’t like the RNs with bare minimum pre requisites and no research but I cannot imagine that some of them will not be impressed with an RN with the same rigor as a bio major with super rich clinical experience and at least one or two poster presentations and research in their portfolio.

4368,t3_1ccsl1h,1714053386.0,"Hi, so context. I'm from New York and have 5 days to chose a college. I've been fortunate enough to be accepted to Northwestern, Georgia Tech, and NYU, which I'm extremely thankful for. Also Cornell offered me a 2025 transfer option that I might consider. I was originally leaning Northwestern, but some people are telling me to take Georgia Tech or Cornell since they're better for my major and after seeing the average CS placement and salary for Northwestern it has me worried as even NYU seems to place better. Could you help me out and tell me if I'm making the right choice going to Northwestern for CS?

Intended Major: Computer Science or Computer Engineering, focus on Security or AI



**Northwestern University**

Cost : Full Ride, so nothing

Pros:

- Research, I've heard Northwestern is really good for getting involved in research which is something I intend to participate in.

- Campus, I loved the lakefront, the design, and the town of Evanston. I visited all 3 schools and liked this one the most. I also like the proximity to Chicago and that it's not exactly in it either.

- Student life, Northwestern seems chill while also being rigorous. I image myself working hard, but also having a pretty fun time there.

- Quarter System, I actually like this as it goes by faster and is more fast paced. It also will let me double major later on which I'm still deciding what I will double major in.

- Ranking, I don't really care about rankings much, but I know it's a T-10 school and has a really good reputation overall.

Cons:

- Programs, I've heard the Engineering and CS programs are weaker than those at GT. Especially for security, that have very little. Though AI has plenty of variety.

- Placement, my biggest worry is that I've seen pretty poor placement, low average salary, and most people say the good tech companies don't recruit. This has be pretty worried for outcomes ig.



**Georgia Tech**

Cost : 17k per year (OOS student who received a pretty generous FASFA)

Pros:

- Programs, by far the best CS and Engineering option I have. Not only do they have more options and resources, their program is also renown. Research seems plausible, but harder to find. That being said, the breadth and quality of courses here is better than Northwestern. They have security and AI options.

- Clubs, more CS clubs and opportunities. Better networking and

- Campus, I liked the campus a lot only a little less than Northwestern. I find their campus very innovative and pretty nice overall.

Cons:

- Student life, I've heard many people are swamped with work and its less chill that Northwestern. For student life I prefer Northwestern a lot more and think I'll have more fun.

- Price, the most expensive at 17k a year.

- Double major, Northwestern has more freedom outside of CS and I don't really know if I could even do a double major at GT.



**New York University**

Cost : 7k per year

Pros:

- Closer to my family and friends, also in NYC which I might return to in the future

- Placement? I've seen NYU has pretty solid placement and better than Northwestern for some reason.

Cons:

- Programs, probably the worst out of the 3 here.

- Cost, 7k a year makes it the 2nd most expensive option here.

- Location, I don't want to commute from my house and don't particularly love the part of NYC that NYU is in.



Also if it helps, I have a 2025 Cornell transfer option which I might pursue, but generally speaking I prefer Northwestern &gt; Cornell for student life, but again the quality of the programs comes up. Again, I'm extremely thankful for all of these options, just worried about outcomes I guess. Sorry for the long thread, any help would be greatly appreciated!



TLDR: Help me decide Northwestern full ride V GTech 17k/yr V NYU

Northwestern: Better student life, research, fit, and cost, decent program but poor placement.

GTech: Better programs and placement, but meh student life and much higher cost.

NYU: Close to friends and family, decent placement, but higher cost and average programs.

Also have a Cornell 2025 transfer pathway which idk.

&gt; If you are not a California resident when you enroll, and you remain a dependent undergraduate, it is unlikely that you will be able to qualify as a California resident for purposes of tuition while you're an undergraduate at UC.

&gt; You do not become a resident for purposes of tuition simply by living in California for 366 days or more. The length of time you attend the University of California or live in California is not the sole determining factor of residency.

&gt; You normally cannot establish California residence for purposes of tuition while maintaining legal ties to another state or country (e.g. state tax liability, driver’s license, voter’s or vehicle registration). **Further, if you have moved to California primarily to attend the University of California, you are here for educational purposes and may not be eligible for a resident classification for purposes of tuition.**

&gt; If your parents live outside of California and you are financially independent, you must also be able to verify financial independence for the two full years preceding the term for which you're seeking residence classification.

&gt;To prove your financial independence, you must be able to document that you have been totally self-sufficient for one full year prior to the residence determination date, supporting yourself, for example, through jobs, financial aid, commercial/institutional loans in your name only, and documentable savings from your earnings.

I am a brazilian student and I really want to work in the financial market in Europe or US, mainly in investment banking or quant trading. I applied for college in US and I only got accepted in Drexel and CSU (57k COA in Drexel and CSU scholarship didn't came up yet). I also was accepted to Hult International Business School in London with tuition currently at 23000 GBP and waiting need based scholarships, but I am not sure about the school's quality (it looks like a scam). Recently I decided to quit electrical engineering in Brazil to focus in studying to more competitive universities, but I am not sure in which to focus. I can choose from trying again for US (which might be hard due to my financial need), applying for universities in Europe (I have spanish citizenship) like IEU or UCIIIM, or studying here in Brazil in good universities (i.e. FGV, USP, or even ITA and IME) and focusing in going abroad only for grad school.

Do any of you have recommendations regarding this? Perhaps some strategy I haven't heard of yet?

For the American Uni people: what could I realistically do in Brazil to improve my chances in US universities during ""gap year""? Btw, currently I have 3.7 GPA, 1470 SAT, 2 golds in nacional astronomy olympiads, 1 bronze in math national olympiad, and MUN best delegate.

4393,t3_1cct8ik,1714054952.0,"Hey guys! Hopefully some outside input will clear up my concerns. I was admitted into NYU’s business school (Stern) and Duke’s Trinity College of Arts and Sciences. It’s been a long time goal of mine to become a dermatologist, but I’m also really interested in business (probably would go into IB, consulting, etc). Stern would mean committing to business and Duke would be premed. 

I’m not to sure how dining or the social scene is at NYU, but Duke has ok dining with social life revolving around greek life (partially because these nothing to do in durham). After visiting both, I definitely love the busy life of NYU compared to Durham. I got the perception that Durham has nothing to do (though i was only there for a few days) so my fear is not having a life outside of the campus. I’d be a lot more comfortable committing to Duke if it had a livelier surrounding. I’d be full pay for both schools and cost of living isn’t something I’m concerned about.

Duke

pros
- good reputation
- collaborative environment
- good school spirit (although not too important to me since i’m not really into sports)
- strong pre-med program which might give me a boost in med school applications
- close to duke medical center 
- abundant research opportunities (?)
- heard it’s relatively easy to connect with professors
- supposedly easier to recruit for consulting (i heard interviewers expect less cuz there’s no business undergrad school)
- grade inflation (?)

cons
- durham is super quiet and honestly not very appealing for the next 4 years (biggest issue for me). It’s possible I just don’t know enough about it yet
- can’t choose where you live. housing system works like a feeder system with certain dorms going to bigger dorms as u progress
- Study abroad program seems lackluster

NYU

pros 
- stern is a reputable business school
- NYC is super fun. short walk to chinatown and soho. I want to live in a big city at least once in my life so maybe I can get it out of my system now
- NYC location could make school year internships possible (but would this be too much to handle?)
- has events where you can win broadway tickets (slightly irrelevant lol)
- there are stern specific events once a year where they take the class out on a trip. freshman year trip is to the US Open
- great study abroad that’s also integrated into certain classes where u can take a short trip over break.
- lots of food options off campus

cons
- nyu doesn’t have much pull
- i’m interested in also pursuing premed but stern would limit me to business. 
- stern curve? = lower GPA even if i tried to do premed requisites
- housing is bad
- no campus (but i can live w that for nyc)

Is it worth it to go here? The graduation rate is pretty low and I’ve heard that’s due to students dropping out due to getting caught in the party life but are there any other reasons for this? Also, how are the opportunities here, is it worth getting a degree from UofA?

How is the food? Is the campus walkable? safe? Are students friendly and is this a nice environment? For a student who’s more on the shy side do you think I would do ok at this school with the class size being so large?

How is the weather? Coming from Ca, I’m used to a sunny environment, but is it always hot? I’ve heard is cooler is Tucson compared to Phoenix? What kind of clothes should I bring? How is Tucson? I’ve heard it’s just a college town but are their things to do (movies, shopping, stores)? Is transportation off campus easy?

How is housing? My top dorms are Arbol, Kaibab, Arizona-Sorona, and Likins. Is dorm life bad? A lot of students don’t live on campus, so is the campus dead on the weekend or are their things to do?

Greek Life. I am actually interested in rushing and joining one of the Divine 9, but if you are not in a frat or sorority is making friends, going to parties, getting involved in college life hard on campus?

How are the amenities? Is there a good amount of exercise equipment/a gym available for us with our tuition on campus?If not, what sort of benefits do we get being there?

4503,t1_l17s8it,1714059869.0,"Oxbridge undergrad courses (what we would call majors) are typically more like US graduate programs.  You will be focused on your specific course, and working closely with the tutors in your college.  You are committed to whatever course accepts you.  Note Cambridge for undergrads has a Natural Sciences course rather than specific courses in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Biochem, Materials Science, or Earth Sciences, although you eventually specialize within Natural Sciences, whereas Oxford has specific courses for those fields.

In contrast, all the Ivies are well within the US liberal arts and sciences tradition, and among other things that means you will be taking many courses outside your major, and indeed outside STEM generally (technically you do not HAVE to do more than the two-course writing requirement at Brown, but you will be strongly advised to branch out).  You will be free to explore different possible majors before committing, and indeed can change your mind more than once.

All this is part of why Oxbridge courses usually only take 3 years, unless you are also getting a Masters in 4.  Obviously Ivy bachelors are typically 4 years, and probably do not go quite as deep into your major as an Oxbridge course (unless you really want to).

The other big difference is the Ivies are also really into the residential college experience, believing a lot of the value of a college experience is nonacademic.  Oxbridge have clubs and such but it is not so much a focus of student life.

My S24 with some STEM interests decided not to apply to Oxbridge, but did apply and get an offer from St Andrews for Biology (quickly, Scottish bachelors-level programs are four years and you can actually explore three courses initially before going down to two and then finally one).

UW Pros:

- Absolutely loved Madison
- Top 10 Program for History and Top 25 for Physics
- Campus and Dorms are amazing!
- Highest ranked/more prestigious
- Will be able to graduate at least a semester early from credit gathered in high school
- Honors Program!

UW Cons:

- I will probably end up paying full price ($40K/yr)
- Farther from home
- Really big

**Binghamton**

Binghamton Pros: 

- $25-30K a year cheaper (in-state)
- Mini Classes I saw on admitted student day were pretty good
- Got into a special program to do first year research
- Smaller student body

Binghamton Cons:

- I hated the town and campus (really depressing and ugly)
- Not nearly as good or prestigious as UW for either one of my majors
- Won’t graduate with Honors
- Would probably dislike going to school here",2024-04-25 12:01:40

I am not sure what the appeal would be versus WUSTL if the costs are the same, since it is also a smaller college with smaller classes, and you would not have to change campuses midway.  Plus it is one of the nicest campuses in the country, with highly rated dorms and dining.  The underclass experience in their South 40 is particularly well-regarded, and St Louis has a lot to do, including lots of free attractions in Forest Park right across from WUSTL.

I mean 528 is cool and all but after 520, the returns on the MCAT are diminishing so you're probably safe after breaking 520. I mean you'll probably get a few bites from some highly ranked schools on MCAT alone but I think it's still hard to convert the interview without at least some research experience. Also regardless of MCAT, your app is DOA without clinicals even at top research heavy medical schools; I think the exception may be some MD/PhD programs but you will need heavy research. Do you have pubs or posters? De facto requirement for schools with high MCAT averages, unfortunately but people do get in with minimal research.

Edit 2: I pulled an all nighter for a biochem final and unironically did not realize this is a shitpost. Most sane premed moment. High schoolers, don't turn into me, touch grass.

4559,t1_l180at1,1714062502.0,"tl;dr - You can join the military (including attending West Point) for whatever reason you want, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The only thing that matters is that you're committed to your time there and your service afterwards. 

Hi there! First of all congratulations! It's extremely hard to get into West Point (in addition to Cornell, Columbia, and Brown..)

With that being said, enlisted of 16 years here chiming in with a different opinion-- I disagree that if you choose West Point for free school, sports, good school, stipend, or whatever reason, then you screwed up. You don't have to choose West Point for the patriotic reason or because you want to lead troops. It helps that you have that mindset already, of course.

I joined the military for the GI Bill, to get a free education, I earned my GI Bill and I continued to serve not because I wanted to be a leader of men or serve my country per se, I continued to serve because it provides stability for my family. I'd say I've done pretty well for myself

Leaving college debt free (and earning $ throughout your 4 years) is a huge boon in this day and age. You get a choice of an immediate stable job for 20 years if you choose or 8 years if you choose.

Have been shortlisted for scholarship at CMU Qatar which might further reduce cost
Carnegie Mellon name + Computer Science degree have a solid reputation
I spoke to some alum and they said it's a good path for Masters or PhD program at top US universities in the future

Cons:


Away from US job opportunities and Qatar market isn’t good (something I realized after speaking to a few alum )
I have also been admitted to main Pittsburgh campus but it is way too expensive although I can afford it with a few loans from family members so not sure how much better CMU Qatar 
Unsure if CMU Qatar carries the same name as its main campus in Pittsburgh 

Purdue University

Pros:
Can work in the US 3 years after graduation
Strong alumni network in the United States, potentially providing better job opportunities and connections for internships and full-time employment.
Located in the United States, which may provide easier access to internships, networking events, and industry conferences
Access to a wide range of research opportunities and resources within the larger Purdue University system, which could be beneficial for pursuing a Master's or PhD.


Cons:
Extra cost compared to CMU Qatar
Public school so large class sizes compared to CMU’s small personalized learning environment
Still unsure if Purdue or CMU Qatar is better in terms of future aspects

CMU Pittsburgh

Pros:
Access to US Jobs
It's my first preference
Reverse of CMU Qatar cons

Con:
Will have to pay 90k a year and take out interest free loans from family ",2024-04-25 13:35:24

-do science Olympiad. It would be fun and a good experience.

4604,t1_l187lui,1714067522.0,"this comment is not from me but from my friend:

Hey! I’ve deleted my Reddit account, but a friend of mine sent this to me and I’m having another friend post it on my behalf.

I also made pretty much the exact same decision as you last year (I was also full pay and OOS) and ended up going with Amherst. I won’t lie, it was an incredibly difficult decision and I quite literally teared up when I pressed the “turn down” button on Michigan’s portal, but I’m ultimately really happy with what I chose. 

First, on cost: After calculating what Ann Arbor housing costs would look like, as well as cost of travel (I can drive to Amherst but have to fly to UMich), the price difference ended up being a wash. I also have very little discretionary spending while at Amherst (&lt;$200 per month), while I’ve heard from friends at Michigan that they tend to spend a bit more. YMMV depending on how much you like spending/where you’re from (i.e. what transportation costs would look like), however.

On the social life, I was also incredibly worried about Amherst’s size before arriving, but I’ve found it completely fine. It’s big enough that I have a vague idea of probably \~1/4 of the student body, know probably \~100 people quite well, and the rest still feels pretty anonymous (although I am still a second-semester freshman; upperclassmen have told me it feels different). I’m neither particularly outgoing nor particularly antisocial, and I’d say I’m familiar with \~1/3 of the students in my class year and have pretty much no idea who the rest are, and that’s after a full year with them. I completely disagree with the idea that “You will know everyone at Amherst by October if you go there” that another commenter mentioned. So, yes, it’s a small school, but I wouldn’t consider it suffocating at all, and there’s also a pretty neat, close-knit community feel. I will also say that the party scene is very different between Amherst and any larger school; I, like many students, don’t really go to parties on a regular basis and prefer to stay in and chill with friends, although there is stuff if you want to go (I particularly enjoy events at the more crunchy-type theme houses, which often have live music). On the other hand, UMich, from what I’ve heard, seems pretty similar to UMass, with a pretty intense frat scene and lots of rah rah school spirit. On the note of school spirit, Amherst doesn’t really have much (our sports game turnout is honestly quite sad); meanwhile, when I was at UMich for admitted students day on a cloudy, dreary day, I could feel the energy coursing through the campus. Amherst is definitely a lot more lowkey in that way, but I went to a high school without much spirit either, so I don’t particularly mind it.

On classs, the largest class I’ve ever been in is 55 people. Three of my four classes this semester are under 15 as a freshman! I’m on first-name basis with about half of my professors, and every single one of them will say hi to me when I see them around. There’s tons of office hours with professors ON TOP OF extensive TA hours, and every one of my professors very clearly are here to teach. I found getting research positions a little frustrating only because the econ and math departments (my majors) tend to be very limited in how many people they can take (you just don’t need that many lab assistants…), but every premed I know has had no problems at all; there are so many labs that I’ve been told that applying to SURF (summer undergraduate research fellowship) in one of those fields essentially guarantees you a position if you’ve taken the requisite classes. Also, weedouts are far more rare; I’ve heard gen chem and intro bio are hard, but it’s nothing like the “hundreds of people dropping” that my friends at larger schools tell me about.

To me, what the decision boiled down to was the level of competition at each school. Michigan does have more opportunities than Amherst, of course; it’s natural for a school with 25x as many students to do so. But Amherst punches significantly more above its weight, and there’s a lot of effort put in by the school to make sure students can get as much experience as they want. I’ve seen the horror stories about the math department at UofM on this subreddit; the Amherst math department alternates between being the most and second most popular on campus, and many of its professors are some of the most beloved on campus, thanks to the effort they put into making math accessible. Clubs here are not allowed to have applications if they want funding from the school. I realized that I could get much of the same outcomes out of Amherst (as someone looking to go into IB/consulting) without having to worry about competing with a few thousand people for them, which really put me at ease. To put it as cynically as possible, I realized that I wouldn’t have to work as hard at Amherst to get what I wanted.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I know it’s a really hard decision. I hope this helps! If you’d like to talk more, feel free to DM this account’s owner; she can give you my Discord or Insta.",2024-04-25 13:52:02

* worried that we might not fit in with the Greek life culture
* worried about huge class sizes

UVA:

* We are in state, but have not been particularly impressed (housing, large class sizes, difficulty to enroll, plus the party scene is not attractive to our student)

Med school acceptance data for large state schools is hard to come by, and largely meaningless, given how diverse the student body is at a large state school.

But you can’t really look at lists of med school acceptance data because you’ll get a false positive — you’ll invariably get a list of schools that send the most people to med school — Harvard, Yale, other Ivies, Stanford, Duke, WashU, etc.

Think about it like this: Does Duke University **PRODUCE** top NBA prospects, or does Duke University **ATTRACT** people who were going to be top NBA prospects regardless of where they went to college?

The “top premed schools” are sort of the same; if you Google it you’ll find a list of schools that **ATTRACT** lots of very smart kids from affluent families — with brains and money being the two most critical factors required of people who end up in medical school — Harvard, Yale, other Ivies, Stanford, Duke, WashU, etc.

Sure, they are all fine pre-med schools, but most of the kids who went to Harvard, etc undergrad and got into medical school would have gotten into medical school no matter where they went to college.

I'm an American high school senior (female Asian/Northeast) trying to decide which college to attend next year and I've narrowed my options to the UGA/Honors and McGill Desautels Faculty of Management. They are pretty different schools, but I have visited them and like them both. I would appreciate any input or advice!

I am looking to have a double major/concentration in Finance (or another business major) and Mathematics.  Job placement and salary is important (although I'm not sure exactly what I want to do). Work/social life balance is also important. 

UGA Overview: I was accepted to the Franklin for a BS in Mathematics and the Honors College. I want to double major in Finance/business major at Terry and was told that it would be doable if I did well in business prerequisites.

UGA Pros:

* Honors has benefits like priority registration, supportive community, funding for extras
* Study abroad opportunities at Oxford and other places
* More American company connections? 
* The professors seemed friendly, encouraging, and accessible
* College spirit, enjoy sports
* Nice campus 
* 20K less than McGill 

UGA Cons:

* Getting into Terry isn’t a sure thing
* Internships may be hard to get according to what I was told
* Could be harder socially- low diversity/ mostly in state/greek life not my thing
* Small college town. I'm more of a city person. Traveling from home is more complicated
* Don’t love hot weather

McGill Overview: I would enroll in McGill's Desautels Faculty of Management and double major/concentration in Finance (or another business major) and Math. 

McGill Pros:

* Internationally known name and program
* Small faculty in a large school
* Experiential learning embedded into the curriculum
* Montreal is great
* I like colder weather (although maybe not THIS cold?)
* Diverse international student body 

McGill Cons:

* Is BCom a serious grind/competitive? Does the curve impact grad school or jobs? 
* Low support (people always say that McGill does no ""hand-holding"")
* Will my lack of French impact internship/work opportunities?
* I am American and wonder if this will impact internship/work opportunities 
* Protests on campus can be disruptive
* More expensive, but doable

as someone who was pre-med and dropped but have friends who stuck with it, i was very challenged, as were my classmates. some spent time in iowa city during the summers doing shadowing work, some went home and shadowed, many stayed on campus to do research with professors, etc. from the moment you step foot on campus, you’re able to go to the careers center and sign up for the pre-health email list as well as start getting in touch with some alumni who have pursued medical school post-grinnell.

one thing i will say to you is that computer science is incredible at grinnell, as is pre-med, but i would very strongly advise you to not do them at the same time. i would advise anyone that. computer science at grinnell is HARD (as i’m sure it is anywhere), and pre-med is incredibly demanding.

do also keep in mind grinnell will be much colder than richmond. if you love snow (as i did), you will love it! because of the size of campus, you’ll really never spend more than 10mins outside getting from one place to another. if the cold/snow are REALLY not your thing, richmond may be the better option.",2024-04-25 14:33:08

Hi, I’m an international IB student and i’m interested in biology, sustainability, technology and business.


 I have two conditional offers from one from UNSW for engineering honours which requires me to get a 33/45 in ibdp and is a 4 year course. For UCL i applied for bioprocessing with b&amp;m which requires me to get a 38/45 in the ibdp which is a 3 year course so if i go here i will apply for a masters in the uk/us after grad. While CWR is an unconditional offer for an undecided major and is a 4 year program. 

I’m not to sure on which to pick, money is not a big problem for me but ideally i would like to a pick a school which will offer me the best job placements and opportunities. 

My end goal is to start and or work for a sustainable tech or biotech company. 

Location wise i prefer sydney or london cause they are cities and i love cities but i wouldn’t mind living in ohio for 4 years. I really want to do a masters in the states either ways hopefully at ucb or Stanford. 

Ik these are very different schools but idk which would be better. Ranking wise UCL is the best followed by UNSW then CWRU. I feel at the end of the day they all provide great opportunities. CWRU also has the bonus of not being tied to a major. I do get some sort of flexibility with UNSW as i go as an undecided engineering major and specialise in year 2 i think (correct me if i’m wrong). UCL on the other hand the course is super interesting and a very small cohort and is only 3 years but from what i heard some professors are not that great there. I feel like all unis have shitty professors tho so im so confused. I wish i had gotten UCL earlier then i would also have more time to think my decision through but what can we do. 

Keeping my goals in mind which school do you think is the best option? ",2024-04-25 15:10:31

For me, the vibe was just off and even though I knew it was a great school, it just wasn't for me. If it had been my state school though, I may have still considered it. Then it comes down to Michigan and Rice. Both are great schools and both offer very different experiences. Does your student prefer a large state school with tons of sports culture and school spirit and a super cute college town, or would they prefer a smaller environment without the large state school vibe? Rice students are also a bit nerdy and quirky which I see as a positive, but others may not. Have you visited both in person? I feel like it's much easier to get a feel if you can visit. There's also a huge difference in weather which you may want to consider. Rice and UMich were two schools that I was very interested in and I applied to both. I ended up being waitlisted at Rice. I did get into UMich, but in the end it was hard for me to justify the cost of attending a large state school at a private school price, so it is not where I ended up. Good luck to your student.

4705,t3_1cd0321,1714073016.0,"I am senior in HS and most likely going to a state school near me. 

A handful of my friends are in NHS and have gotten accepted to a local liberal arts school. The school purports to have a 48%acceptance rate on their website, but a Google search says closer to 60%. Don’t know if acceptance rates are higher for early admissions?

Anyway - my senior class has around 300 to 350 in it (I can’t get accurate numbers anywhere online - so I did US News). 200 people in that class are on the honor roll. According to Homes.com, the average GPA of our high school is 3.5, but average SAT is 1100. 

My friends have gotten into this “elite” local liberal arts school (the 48% acceptance rate). They take two AP classes but failed both college board exams to get the credit, and they received 1000 on the SAT. This school is test optional. They were accepted early. 
They will be taking out loans in the amount of 80k

They seem to criticize my choice for going to state school, but I don’t want all of the debt and my mom can help pay for it. They say I will not stand out in job interviews, etc. 

In terms of my grades, my gpa is lower than theirs (3.8 weighted and theirs is 4.2). My SAT is 1250 and theirs is 1000

I have two questions:

1. Is it worth the debt (80k) to switch to this more elite private school (I would be majoring in business). Just don’t know what to expect first year salary and if I would make more than 80 to pay it off. This is not an Ivy League - a liberal arts school with 48 to 60 percent acceptance rate




2. Assuming I do decide, would I be setting myself up for failure?  More than half my senior class is on the honor roll and the average GPA is 3.5, yet the college readiness score is C on Niche and 17/100 on US News and average SAT is 1100.  My friends seem to think they are going to have a ball in these honors classes at this college, but in my mind they are not considering that we go to a school where 60%of class is on the honor roll, so maybe we aren’t going to prepared for the rigor.

\*I won’t lie, I know really little about career pathways, so please let me know if I have a flawed understanding on anything. Thanks!

Values: I value freedom, both in the short term and long term. This means flexibility for growth and branching out in career pathways, and not having my social life and other passions held down by my career. I know this isn’t an uncommon desire as a lot of people wish for eventual financial freedom, and that nothing is guaranteed, but I was wondering which school would maximize my chances of reaching my values. 

CMU Pros:

1. (Significant?) Edge in name recognition in the tech industry
2. Can study both hardware and software, allowing me to branch out in interests
3. On track to complete Masters in AI Program in at most an extra semester, likely in 4 years.
4. Wonderful startup culture and inspiring, ambitious students to work with
5. Close to home

CMU Cons:

1. Weather is not my favorite
2. Campus social life seems dead when I visited(might have been impacted by the weather)
3. Received 0 aid
4. Intense curriculum that may take away from the short term “freedom” that I want

GaTech Pros:

1. Solid name recognition in CS industry
2. Almost half the cost of CMU in tuition
3. Fell in love with campus culture/life immediately when I arrived
4. On track to graduate within three years
5. Less demanding curriculum, giving me more short term “freedom”

GaTech Cons:

1. Overcrowded CS departments make it more difficult to access internships and unique opportunities
2. I see GaTech as a software engineer factory, where students often end up in general software roles. I also believe GaTech would be edged out by CMU in the industry.
3. I also don’t think there are as many pathways or growth for GaTech compared to CMU post graduation.

I am confident I can thrive at both colleges. I just believe that CMU is better for the long term for what I want, and GaTech is better for the short term. Wouldn’t it be more wise to consider the long term? I am also wondering how large the difference between CMU and GaTech is in terms of prestige and long term career outcomes / pathways.",2024-04-25 15:35:28

You might be interested in this study of the top feeders to T14 law schools, particularly the per capita version (the second list):

[https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/top-feeders-law-school](https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/top-feeders-law-school)

Pomona is #14, between Brown and Penn.  UCLA is high on the total list (#10, just after Penn), but not on the per capita list at all (Berkeley is, but not UCLA).  In fact total, UCLA was 1944 over the study period, Pomona 320.  UCLA has like 19 times as many undergrads, so Pomona placed graduates in top law schools at over 3X the adjusted rate as UCLA during this study period.

Now, very likely a lot of that is self-selection (meaning more Pomona grads want to go to top law schools), and some of it may just be correlation (like, maybe Pomona students do a bit better on the LSAT on average, who knows).

But one thing we can say for sure is Pomona is not somehow lagging UCLA in terms of supporting graduates in getting into top law schools.  Quite the opposite.

There is more like that.  Here, for example, is a similar PhD feeders study:

[https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/top-feeders-phd-programs](https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/top-feeders-phd-programs)

I am not sure what Social Sciences might interest you, but we can start with Sociology.  UCLA is #6 on the total list with 23 in the study period, Pomona #6 per capita with 9.  That's about a 7.5X rate.  Again, lots of self-selection and other factors involved, but Pomona is certainly not lagging in terms of support for PhD intenders in Sociology.

Quickly some more (UCLA total, Pomona total, adjusted ratio):

Psych: 133, 29, 4X

Poli Sci: 16, 6, 7X

Econ: 21, 13, 12X

Again, I would not be worried about Pomona's ""name"" in these fields!

OK, so the bottom line is top LACs like Pomona have incredibly good placement rates in grad programs and professional schools.  Lots of self selection and mere correlation is involved in that, but still, if you have such ambitions, a top LAC is usually a great choice.",2024-04-25 15:50:14

I have 1560 SAT, 4.3 GPA, 6 APs, and really good ECs. However, I have transferred four times in the four years of my high school due to family reasons, so I was rejected by the Ivies and waitlisted by my reaches. Both BU and Northeastern also seem to find my application fishy. Therefore, I was only accepted to BU's CGS (College of General Studies) program and Northeastern's Global Scholar program. The CGS program basically means I can't declare a major and I have to study general courses for two years before I transfer to BU's College of Arts and Sciences. The Global Scholar program is similar: I have to study in London and Oakland each for a semester, and the courses are all pretty basic. 

My school counselor told me both programs are just glorified community colleges. Personally, I want to transfer to a Top 20 school, and my counselor told me going to CGS and Global Scholar would hurt my chances of transferring. He believes that I should choose UMiami and Rutgers because they both have decent poli-sci and philosophy courses, and Rutgers' philosophy department is even ranked No. 2 in the country.

I don't have any financial concerns or preference for location. I care about academics, and my family cares only about prestige. 

What should I do? Does anyone have experience transferring to a Top 20 out of CGS or the Global Scholar program? I really hope to get some advice. Thank you.

I’m an engineering major and considering either Materials Science and Engineering or Civil and Environmental Engineering.

UMD
Pros:
Friends are going, 
Honors College, 
Larger dorms, 
Safer

Cons:
Not as prestigious, 
Graduates make less, 
Large classes, 
Competition for internships and jobs

Rice
Pros:
Overall a better school, 
Lots of biomed opportunities, 
Small class sizes, 
Easier to change majors

Cons:
Texas, 
Less safe, 
Farther from home

In terms of cost, both will cost about the same according to my fincaid. I’m not sure about the job market afterwards, because I’ll probably want to work in the NE.

I recently finished my B.A. in English Technical Communication and for one reason or another I am fully invested in getting a 2nd degree in Computer Science. My main concern when looking at application requirements are the pre-requisite courses that I do not have. These include: analytical geometry 1,2, and 3, and either physics 1 or Calc 1 with lab. My math background isn't the strongest and it's not a lack of skill but more so a lack of taking the time to learn it when I was originally in highschool. So I understand I'll need to take some extra courses to build up my math background. 

With that said does anyone have a tier list/ order of reccomendations on math courses I should begin taking. I have applied to one school for a B.S. in Comouter Science, but likely I will need to go back to community College to build up my math skills and then tackle those pre-requisites listed.

Intended major: undecided, but likely polisci or maybe econ (possibly prelaw)

**Boston College**

BC Pros:

* I love Boston
* Easier to go home and closer to friends
* Very highly ranked compared to my other options
* Beautiful campus
* Smaller and more personable
* more into the sports and campus culture there than the craziness of Penn State
* feels like my kind of place
* Good hockey team

BC Cons:

* \~$150k of student loans (This is the big one, especially if I want to go to grad or law school)
* Jesuit, and I'm not religious (not a huge deal)
* not great prelaw program
* basically no chance of switching into business if thats something I want to do

Penn State

Penn State Pros:

* Cheaper, likely no student loans but use up all money from parents
* Slightly better prelaw program
* Good sports culture, maybe too much for me though
* Great Honors College (which I am currently on the waitlist of - this could change my decision)
* Good alumni network

Penn State Cons:

* In the middle of nowhere
* Way too big for me (maybe unless in the honors college)
* Overwhelming party culture
* Not as good of a school
* doesn't feel like my type of people",2024-04-25 17:12:20
4833,t3_1cd2yaq,1714079566.0,"Hello,

I finally narrowed it down to two colleges from my acceptance list. I got into engineering at GT and [Olin](http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/colleges-and-universities/olin-college/384). Both of them are out of state schools for me (coming from the west coast). I visited both colleges in person.

GT:

\[1\] Obviously top #3 in engineering for ME, AE, or engineering in general, as the tech is top notch.

\[2\] GT has a lot of courses and research in aerospace (which is my liking at the moment).

\[3\] The weather is nicer compared to Boston (lol, no question about it, but not a dealbreaker).

\[4\] You will get a much more typical college experience.

\[5\] You can select ME, AE or EE in your second year and have more electives to choose from.

\[6\] Costs more than Olin for sure as public schools won't give more need-based aid compared to Olin.

Olin:

\[1\] I like Olin’s small class sizes and project-focused curriculum and Candidate weekend was a good experience.

\[2\] Small campus and dorms/food are all good.

\[3\] It will be cheaper compared to GT for sure as they stack need-based and merit-based aid.

\[4\] They're losing some $6 to $8 million per year and worried about cost-cutting. So I am worried that my experience and its future reputation are at risk.

\[5\] Boston winter isn't fun but a small campus where walking distance can be 5 to 10 minutes of walk takes out the weather factor but still you're gonna feel it.

\[6\] ONLY three options ME, EE or general electronics.

Any advice or additional information anyone would like to share....thank you",2024-04-25 17:12:46

2. the thing is i would go to italy because the university is extremely cheap and you basically only pay your living costs there
3. the university in italy is internationally recognized and its ranked like a 100 schools higher than umiami in the general category and like 400-450 schools above in the computer science category which i know is kinda obsessed about over here but umiami i believe has more connections to big companies and my end goal in where i want to live is probably the us. although yk its not like i can't get into a masters program in the us and move to the us like that so...
4. also like the fact that i can finish school in three years is more appealing than finishing in four not only because its over quicker but also because it will be cheaper overall.

there are more advantages and disadvantages for both unis for me but the biggest factor is the financial aid. i am to be given the president scholarship if i attend miami but i dont know about the need aid because i havent filled out the fafsa but i predict the net price per year for both unis is going to be similar. i also have a small question before i end this, if i pay the enrollment deposit and i am not given the financial aid package i need, is there a chance i could revoke my enrollment? thanks in advance.",2024-04-25 17:24:19

I’ve always envisioned myself in a bigger college campus and that’s exactly what PSU is. I also feel like since I’ll actually be away from family and everyone I know I’ll be forced to come out of my shell and be independent. The problem is PSU had not offered me any money and it’s a very expensive school that is not easy for me to afford especially when I want to go to dental school.

VT offers the quintessential “big college” experience with spirited ACC athletics, 800+ clubs and student organizations, 30,000+ undergrads, great dining hall food, and a friendly, laidback vibe. W&amp;M has smaller scale athletics; 450+ clubs and student organizations; 6,800+ undergrads; okay dining hall food; and students who are reputed to be bright, intense, quirky, and individualistic. But both colleges are large enough for you to find your people no matter what vibe you prefer.

I only ever wanted to go to one Ivy League university from the day I heard its name. It was *perfect* for me—had everything I wanted. I visited campus and adored it. There was no other university for me. 

I applied, was accepted, and attended. 

And while I did love every minute of it, it ended up being a huge mistake. 

Because medical school was my goal, and the university had a mandatory bell curve, with the median being the B/C border, for every introductory and intermediate science and math class).

Imagine having to compete for A's at a university where everyone was in the top 1% to 4% of their high school graduating class. And not just grades, but independent research projects, research assistantships,  internships, jobs, you name it. 

I just never could earn the GPA I needed to be a decent candidate for medical school. 

In the summer when I was a rising senior, I went to take some summer classes at a very well-respected public university, and I was simply amazed at how easy the exams were! The questions were so straightforward! They were exactly what was taught in class and in the texts. They didn't assume you memorized the textbook and lectures, and then expected you to extrapolate and apply your knowledge to novel circumstances. It was so nice walking into a final, knowing I passed the class without needing to even take it, and all I needed to get an A for the class was a 65%. I ended up earning 798 out of a possible 800 points for the class (and I'm still a little pissed off about those last two points!).

Option A) **Apply to Uni in the US as international student living with family**
1. I would have to go to a university/community college nearby in my state because I’m living with family and it isn’t culturally normal to move out. However, I don’t want to be living with my family in the US as the oldest child, I’ve had enough with my parents not allowing me the space and time to do my work and actually live my life. Oldest children of toxic families who read this may relate and understand. 
2. Me studying undergrad in the US means we’re going to live here (immigration) according to parents. This is a con for me; can’t elaborate because it’s personal, but I grew up for most of my life in the U.S. and experienced things that have impacted me negatively, from dad getting cancer to financial issues and bad community. I prefer the U.S. for travelling and maybe studying grad, but certainly not for living.
3. US universities think international students have money, but I’m poor; my mom was a teacher in my home country but she can’t work in the US due to visa restrictions. Dad works in delivery and is gone all day. I can’t work because of visa restrictions. So, very low income.

Option B). Therefore, I think the best decision would be for us to **migrate back to my country** because some of us have citizenship there with more rights, which my mom agrees with. But…
1. My country is a “third world country” and the university I would go to there doesn’t even know what IB diploma program is, so I’d be receiving no credits or anything. The university may be easier for my intended major, but it feels like I worked hard in high school for nothing which stings a little.
2. We own a small apartment that will be a bit cramped for us because we’re a big family. Trying to build a house, but construction is paused. The country is relatively stable, but there’s a political and economic risk that could cause the country to quickly relapse into conflict. The currency exchange rate also went up a little… :/
3. English is not the main language but I’m fluent in the main language there. However, it will be difficult for my younger siblings to adjust because of their level of the language in addition to the school curriculum being much more difficult than the US. 

I want to study either English Literature or international studies so I plan to get my bachelors in my country, and then study abroad with the aim of moving abroad, particularly to a French speaking country. I have a weak passport so legally I’m already in a disadvantage, but I’m still gonna try as it’s something I thought about for a while. My parents though aren’t keen about letting me move abroad on my own. I’m responsible and such but their reason why is….simply because I’m a woman lol. 

**TL;DR:** It feels like I can’t make any plans for my future because it’s tied to my parents’ decision whether we stay in the US or move and it’s been frustrating, making me really stressed.

Similarities: Schools are very closely ranked so it is tough to choose between both  

UW Madison  

School 1 Pros: 

\-Better College social life 

\-Got in for Letters and Sciences as UW Madison only admits to the college rather than the major 

\-Very similar COA to UMD (Around 60k) 

\-Has a good master's program that I'm interested in 

\-Heard that they have good ML research 

\-Campus appeals to me a bit more  

School 1 Cons: 

\-Cold weather 

\-Heard that overcrowding is an issue in CS  

UMD  

School 2 Pros: 

\-Better internship opportunities 

\-Better location (DC) 

\-Directly admitted to CS rather than letters and sciences 

\-Very similar COA to UW Madison (Around 60k) 

\-Has a good master's program as well but heard it's competitive as there are only 20 seats 

\-Weather is great 

\-UMD is cutting down on transfers and making the major more competitive so it shouldn't be that overcrowded in the upcoming years  

School 2 Cons: 

* College life is not as great as at UW Madison

UMN Twin Cities

School 3 Pros:

\-Got a scholarship of 15k/year. COA will be around 43k per year 

\-Decent location as I heard Minnesota has a good job market. 

\-Might not be as competitive as the other two.

School 3 Cons:

\-Cold Weather

\-Not sure about how different it is compared to the other 2 schools as I haven't done much research on UMN. Trying to understand if the other colleges are really worth the extra cost

Tiebreaking considerations: 

\-I'm currently leaning towards UMD due to the location and considering the better opportunities. 

\-I cannot visit the campuses as I'm OOS but live outside of the USA",2024-04-25 18:04:12

UChicago Pros:

* lots of people from my area going there, this year and in the past (hopefully a support network)
* really great for econ if I decide to go into that
* ""houses"" within dorms
* loved my visit
* well known, big name
* larger alumni network
* has a law school &amp; business school, possibly undergrads favored in admissions?
* probably more internship opportunities nearby
* beautiful campus
* seems to have a sense of humor
* shifting towards pre-professional rather than academic
* higher starting salary

UChciago Cons:

* safety (sorry I know everybody says this but i really don't think i have street smarts and that kind of concerns me)
* rigor of coursework (although i'm not too concerned about this, people from my high school who went there told me college is still much easier)
* more anonymous experience
* cost (about the same for both rip)
* seems to be slightly newer to top rankings, maybe less prestigious? though it does seem to generally rank higher internationally
* very sad weather

**Amherst College**

Amherst College Pros:

* smaller class sizes (can someone confirm this? when I did some research it seemed like UChicago actually had a better student:faculty ratio but that seems strange to me)
* more accessible professors
* supposedly very helpful alums (though I worry about how accessible this would be to me due to reputation of elitism?)
* pretty good law school feeder (though again, is that just because there are a lot of rich kids who know somebody?)
* hopefully very tight-knit community
* apparently a lot of students have pets?
* seems to be considered very prestigious among people who know of it

Amherst College Cons:

* small student body (what if i hate people and i have to see them every day lol)
* reputation for being kind of elitist?
* visit was mid
* sort of rural, not many opportunities for internships nearby
* travel would be difficult (not near major airports)
* don't know anyone who goes there
* smaller alumni network
* not as well known
* just a lot more uncertainty for me (as you can tell by the question marks) since i don't know anyone there
* cost (about the same for both rip)
* lower starting salary (I know most kids go to grad school after LACs, but I still want to have career options even if i ultimately decide i want to work right after undergrad)

Starting salaries are a strong function of the cost of living in the areas where graduates go (as well as short vs long term career path). I would not read much into one school or another having higher earnings - your major, and your skills matter a lot more. Same with any concerns about “prestige”. Applicants and university PR offices are the people who care most about that. 

In terms of safety, UChicago is as safe as any school in a major city. Chicago is not the crime capital that it’s portrayed as in some corners of the media. Hyde Park is an affluent neighborhood with direct access to parks and cultural institutions. Chicago winters are also overhyped. 

As far as faculty ratio is concerned, prestigious research universities always have good on paper ratios. Most of those people have a primary job that doesn’t involve undergraduates however.

I am saying that as someone who is not obsessed with prestige. (My own son just chose a full-ride at U of Arkansas over Cornell.) However, an R1 flagship state school (even one like Arkansas that isn’t really highly ranked along the lines of Cal-Berkeley or UNC) is different than a place like Centre. It is a decent school and I’ve heard of Centre, but most people haven’t. Bottom line: if your family hasn’t saved any 529 money and/or can’t afford to comfortably contribute a decent amount over next four years, it is probably smarter to take the full ride at Centre unfortunately.

Barnard College Pros

* Very generous financial aid package \~10k a year
* New York City &amp; I love love love the campus
* Has been my dream school for so long and has several Econ courses I would love to take
* Competitive school with a more diverse student body
* Access to internships and opportunities in the city

Barnard College Cons

* Courses are academically rigorous, so I am unsure if I will have enough time to partake in clubs and internships
* COMPETITIVE STUDENT BODY
   * I am unsure if I can have access or be on par with other students for internships and opportunities
   * Clubs also seem difficult to get involved in
   * NYC &amp; Columbia have a large saturation of talented students
      * like seriously, can I even get any scholarships or opportunities here
* Coffee is like $10, and I love coffee
* No business major
   * However, my priority has always been to major in economics

CU Boulder Pros:

* Financial aid not out yet, but received several scholarships &amp; some are recurring
* Leeds Scholars Program: not a ton of alumni information, but seems comparable to programs at T20s
   * 8% acceptance rate with 46 students for this cohort
   * Travel abroad first year, second semester
   * Access to mentors, internships, and employers
* Puksta Scholars Finalist
* I intend on applying to the Diverse Scholars Program as well

CU Boulder Cons

* Colorado (see people I currently attend school with)
* Unsure of the merit behind these scholarships and programs
* I have been near the top of my class for the longest time, and I want to challenge myself and grow as a person
* Not many extracurriculars that I am interested in/feel will be very immersive
* I will never be able to stop thinking about what my life would have been like if I had went to Barnard

UC Riverside:

Okay this one kinda seems like an oddball compared to my other options but I have my reasons

Pros
- Cal resident + my parents offered to pay my tuition if I go here so no debt!! 🥳 - California road trips! (I get a car to drive up to see my family in the Bay Area)
- Literally known for being one of the most diverse campuses (I’m Filipino so it’s rlly important for me to at least find some people of the same background as me to vibe with in college) — plus I visited the campus and they have these little rooms for each affinity group over there
- In SoCal! So that means it’s sunny :D ☀️
- One of my lowest priorities but I’d be closer to my gf and a bunch of our other friends who are also going to school in SoCal (one of them just committed to UCR)
- If I feel like transferring to another UC (lowkey might), I’d have a much better shot at that versus if I went to my other options (ik community is better for this but I’ve also heard it’s harder to get ur classes done at community in 2 years plus I want the full undergrad experience)
- New business school remodeling!! (I’m a Pre-Business major)
-Overall might just have a better sense of community (mostly just bc demographics of the school)

Cons
- Might wanna transfer outta UCR anyways because I heard that not many employers come down there 
- UCs just aren’t that good for me career/undergrad degree wise because I wanna go into Finance and they don’t have my specific concentration (plus they’re just overall limited undergrad business degree wise) 
-In comparison to CC, transferring is more difficult 
-In comparison to my other options, UCR isn’t as name brand (semi-important but not rlly to me)

Fordham:

Pros

- Really good for business AND if I wanna music minor! (New York City 🤭‼️)
    - Financial capital and broadway 🤭💫
- Half tuition + parental support 🤑‼️ (only paying $20k a year I think) 
    - Ab $800-1k would be my monthly payment 
- Jesuit institution so they have major emphasis on Social justice ! (Something I’m rlly passionate ab)
- Great for law if I ever wanna get into that 
    - The 3+3 law degree program lookin pretty good ngl 
- Stronger Asian community!
- The New York City aesthetic 😩 🏙
- They have my specific concentration 
- Also the business school is absolutely BEAUTIFUL (they have the ticking stock market thing :00) 

Cons

* Mostly just opportunity costs from other schools (esp neu which would be great experience and career wise) 
* TONS of classes and gen ed requirements not even going towards my major (more of a mid thing than con tbh)
    * Probably would have the most classes if I ever go here 
    * Like language, science, theology 😭😭 
* Ik I said the Jesuit thing was a plus but I lowkey don’t know how I feel ab going to another religious institution for my education (had that in middle school and high school alr)
* Limited study abroad opportunities if I do the 3+3 program

Northeastern

Pros:
* Lowkey built a community over here with neu peeps on insta already 
* I get to travel in college!! (But not for a whole once I’m out 😀)
    * Oakland first sem; London second sem
        * I’m from the Bay Area so I don’t consider Oakland as a con bc it’s a nice transition into college 
    * Plus the dialogues, semester in, and other study abroad’s 
    * That one fashion dialogue 🤭‼️
* So easy to switch/add on majors 
    * I’d major in Fintech/Finance with a minor in fashion 
* They have a fashion minor here!! (Another thing I’m interested in)
* Co-op!! (This is obvious)
* Filipino club! (Also called barkada)
    * They have another Filipino org that’s connected to a bunch of other Boston colleges 
* I’m not on just one campus! (Great for seeing the world and broadening my horizons :D)
* Bought a ton of NEU merch alr 

Cons: 
* $50k a year is absolutely foul 😭😭
* $1.7k-2k a month 😀😀
* Tons of white people 😭 (which isn’t bad but it’ll be much harder finding my people)
    * Me and my gf had to search for hours finding a single Filipino or at least Asian person on the NEU class of 2028 page 💀
* Snow!! 😃 (more of a like mid reality check thing than a con tho)
* I’m not on just one campus (Tons of moving around and not a strong sense of community 😭)
* Might have to take summer classes?? Depends on how my credits transfer

Santa Clara University:

Currently on the waitlist for this school but semi-considering just in case I get off it 

Pros:
- My kuya/older cousin goes here already so he can hook me up to a bunch of clubs and give me advice and stuff (plus he’s alr very active in 
- Barkada club!! Rlly active and rlly strong sense of Filipino community!! (Just saw their Filipino showcase last night and I LOVED it)
- (Joke pro) Kuya said the girls are rlly hot there 😀
- Good for business and finance 
- California road trips !! 
- Sun !! 
- Can stop by my other cousin’s house to bother him and won’t have to pay for dinner sometimes :p
- Again close to home but far enough to establish my own independence 
- I get my own car!!
- Silicon Valley!! 

Cons:
- Opportunity Costs from other schools

Without going into too much detail, their formulas don’t take into account the details of our particular situation (negative income, lots of younger siblings, high assets on hand because it’s being used to start a business). He would need to go into about $120K debt to pay off his undergrad experience. He is planning on getting a Ph.D in astrophysics. The kid is brilliant. He got into two ivies from a public school without any college coaching because he’s gifted in math and physics and has an incredible work ethic. 

On the other hand, he could go to our state flagship or an out-of-state state school on a full tuition scholarship and graduate debt free. Neither school is a top 50 public university, although the out-of-state, University of Arizona, is known for its astronomy program and he’d be in the honors college for each. 

(He was also accepted to Wash U, Rice and Harvey Mudd, but their aid packages were lower than the Ivies.)

We have a frugal family culture and so he’s leaning toward U of A. I know the arguments about going to a state school and graduating debt free. Both my husband and I took that path and ended up in highly selective careers in Manhattan. I’ve read the Nate Silver  article and I’ve seen firsthand many successful friends start at a public school and end up with an Ivy graduate degree and rise to the top of their field.

On the other hand… I can’t help but think we’re being short sighted. The opportunities at U of A pale in comparison to what Princeton and Yale have to offer in terms of research, travel, networking, and mentorship. His chosen field is so competitive that I wonder if it is worth the debt to have both the prestige of an Ivy degree and the opportunities it affords.

Ultimately it’s his decision and I’ll support whatever he decides. I’d just like to gather some data points to aid his decision process.

first, i'm a hater, and the small school size is actually not that big a deal. i hate a lot of people and do a great job of avoiding them (unless theyre in my classes but thats true of literally any college).

the elitism doesnt really exist here anymore than other schools. everyone i know form Chicago is way more elitist imo. 60% of the students are on financial aid, which plays a big part in this. 

its not rural really, the area is suburban, but you probably arent doing many off campus internships during the year at either school. even still, plenty of law firms, congressional offices, etc in the area if you crave an internship (and accessible via public transport.)

i knew no one here as well, it wasnt a problem. 

smaller alumni network is true but we have a very dedicated and wealthy alumni network that is happy to help everyone, not just amherst grades. we also have less people who regularly contact alumni so it kinda balances out.

not being as well known is true but it is to hiring managers, grad schools, etc.

as for the lower starting salary, this isnt really an amherst thing but more of a self selection thing. a lot of people go to grad school, take low-paying non profit jobs and do fulbright grants (which pay pennies). like, amherst allows access to almost any job on the market. like, fulbright is our 9th biggest post grad employer whihc is kinda wild. the whole list, if you're interested is: Amherst College

Hi, I wanted to major in a field CS related and/or heavily connected to CS

Uiuc Pros  
\- Grainger college of Engineering so wonderful access to resources  
\- I like the campus

Uiuc cons:  
\- No scholarship  
\- Major I got into is very general engineering courses so I would try to switch into Computer Engineering (I'm aware very hard) or one of the CS + X Majors (don't know how hard) or possible something related to data science (would love more input on this)

Santa Cruz Pros:  
\- 10k scholarship per year  
\- CS degree

\- Sillicon Valley

Santa cruz cons:  
\- have heard very mixed reviews about CS program, some say it's great and some say it's bad b/c you can't get your classes and/or very hard to find internships",2024-04-25 19:43:49

Why anyone would want to major in math affter what Ilya Sutskever said at an MIT symposium on 7 October is beyond me, but as you do, what in the world do you want to do with it? Taking lots of math: FANTASTIC idea. Majoring in math: HORRIBLE idea. Maybe you've heard of something called AI? Could be worse, like majoring I data science. Ever used Code Interpreter. (It still exists in GPTs.)

Sorry for being snarky, but majoring in math is like a novelist majoring in typing: Math is just a tool. Sometimes it's the most important tool. But it's just a tool.

I bring this up because it's pertinent to which school you choose. 

Here's an exercise: Where do you want to work? Which type of job would you like to do? Check the job postings. What are they looking for? Maybe math is fine. Maybe it isn't.

Besides, if you study math, you'll need a graduate degree. But in what? And which degree? JD? (Math majors do well on the LSAT.) Ph.D.? For a math Ph.D., Cornell is just slightly ahead of CP in raw numbers.  (I'm assuming you're talking about CP, not BC.) However, in a guide used by grrad schools (for admissions purposes), both Cornell and BC -- but not CP -- are listed as tier 1 in math.

Anyway, you need to think through what you're going to do with it.

I wish you all the best. Remember, you can always transfer to UMD. Cornell is transfer friendly, but not nearly as friendly as UMD.",2024-04-25 19:44:17

Source- she made a post about her college results a while ago and then deleted it before the new one
I even told her about it and she was still lying, till someone called her out and she deleted the whole post.

I know the internet is a crazy place and people lie about a lot of shit, but I think making up a whole fake scenario about getting accepted somewhere you didn’t get into, and putting on the internet is kind of desperate and sad.

College admissions isn’t going to define you, stop lying to yourself and begin to appreciate the choices you have.

So recently I got admitted to UCI’s COSMOS program, and am super stoked to be attending. I am also looking into local volunteer programs to help kids learn about science during June, that helps with a personal theme of mine. However, I have a few dilemmas about college classes I should be taking over the summer.

&amp;#x200B;

I have taken Spanish 2 (native speaker, taking ap exam this year) and French 1 at my high school, but no language my junior year. Thus, I’ll be doing a fast paced course of French 1 and 2 this summer to be qualified for UC applications. I’m pretty sure I will be able to handle this, a volunteering project, and COSMOS, as I already have some background knowledge in French. However, I am also interested in some coding and astronomy classes at my local community college. 

&amp;#x200B;

Astronomy has two classes that would either be a summer or a semester long, and coding has two classes that would also either be a summer or a semester long. Each class would be 3-5 hours a week over a semester, but 8-11 hours a week over the summer. Should I save these classes for my senior year, or get a head start over the summer?

UC Davis's relative proximity to the Silicon Valley might be its differentiator, although I live in the Bay Area so I can always go home during the summer for internships.

I recommend reaching out to admissions to ask to customize your tour based on your interest. I had a 1 hour discussion with a math professor and he was very honest about UTD *not* being a good place for a pure mathematics undergraduate degree if you want to go into academia (he said Austin was the place for math), but he DID say that the engineering department was first-rate, so if you're engineering definitely check it out. Also if you're premed definitely check it out because I met many premed people that loved it there.

so while I didn't choose UT dallas, I really appreciate how honest he was. I think if you make sure that UT Dallas can fit your goals (which it definitely can for engineering and premed) it's a really good option. They pay you to go and there's definitely a good social life within the honors college. (Don't listen to the whiners on r/utdallas, please. The current students had a Q&amp;A about social life away from parents and they made it clear that there was a strong social life if you're dorming, which is good for honors students because they get big fancy dorms) I would love to go if only it was good for math.",2024-04-25 20:42:47

Cannot understate the long-term benefits of attending these schools. I came from a first-gen, low-income background (parents made &lt; $60k) so was lucky enough to get a full-ride, but even with the benefit of hindsight, I’d still go even if it was full pay. A tangible example: I met my fiancé at one of those inter-Ivy social events in NYC (another “hidden” benefit). She’s in the same field as me (finance) so it’s nice to have a combined household income of $600-700k in our mid-20s/just a few years out of UG. I have friends in even more lucrative fields making more (firms like Jane Street and DE Shaw actively recruit on campus). Ik your son is not pursuing finance, but there’s still a benefit to being friends with successful people later on in life. 

OP, I’m seeing a lot of insane comments here because of the $120k difference. I would understand if the difference was $120k/year, but $120k over 4 years to attend one of the best universities is a bargain (70% off sticker) and will pay for itself.",2024-04-25 21:03:19

The vast, vast majority of students don't do that.  At \*least\* a third of the students enrolled at Ivy+ type schools have a lower SAT score than that, and nothing says you have to target those types of schools.

Re: AP courses: Every top school advises applicants to pursue a challenging course of study and, if possible, to take each of the five core subjects all four years (English, math, science, social studies, foreign language).  How many AP courses that translates to will depend entirely on your high school.  At some it might be zero.  At the campus I'm most familiar with, it ends up being around 11.  You are not at all obligated to fill up your elective slots with elective AP courses.  In fact, that may actually be detrimental considering the opportunity cost of what you might take instead.

Re: SAT scores, it comes more easily to some than to others.  Don't assume that getting a 1500 will require a herculean amount of effort.  It might, or it might not.",2024-04-25 21:30:05

Yesterday I was received a scholarship and financial aid from chapman. With all of that, I would pay 49k yearly for chapman, scholarships and aid included. That's pretty good since the tuition is originally 69k. But with UCR, the tuition without aid is cheaper. I think UCR is 43K yearly with housing included, and my financial aid package got delayed (idk how long). I just feel like UCR is a cheaper option overall.

I even went to highlander day and I liked UCR more than I previously did. 😭

I'm pretty sure Chapman has a better business school than UCR but it's not that much of a difference, I think?
I got waitlisted at UCSD and SDSU and i KNOW that it's not guranteed but I was thinking of commiting to UCR and

5181,t3_1cd9l14,1714097053.0,"Im about to graduate high school,

I seriously don’t know what to do afterwards, as far professional/career wise, I’m not sure. 

I’ve been working “crabby job that a teenager would work” ever since I was 16, can’t believe that 3.5 years have already passed by. 

I know that my peers and family won't take me seriously if I don't take things seriously or enroll in college or do something else. It will be assumed by others that I gave everything up to work at a bad job if I continue to work there

I’m terrible at math, seriously, I almost wasn’t certified to graduate because of math, I got lucky with COVID and summer school, I don’t know if I should to university though. 

I heard the rumors on the internet, “don’t go to university, only go if you want to be a lawyer, doctor or an engineer.” I’m for sure not going to school for engineering why would I go to just miserably surfer? Hardcore math isn’t my thing.

Only major that caught my eye was marketing, I’m assuming that I can study this major, graduate and just work a regular office job with my degree and make a good salary. That’s what the lifestyle I expect after I graduate with that degree, but I could be wrong, there’s people who despise the 9-5 route the “matrix route.” 

But if that was the case that would be better than me working my current crappy job for life.

Then there are the ridiculous 14-year-old TikTokers in the style of Andrew Tate, who have no clue how to start their own business. They genuinely say things like, ""I'm going to drop out of high school and watch every single Andrew Tate video, take notes, and by no time I'll be a millionaire."" - Does that truly work, you know? or how does it operate? It seems like no one will ever post a simple solution or even a YouTube video explaining how to get out of the matrix. However, the point of this entire paragraph is irrelevant.

One more random idea In my mind, I thought that since university is so expensive, what if I had to pay an outrageous amount of money each semester or asked my parents for assistance? What if I ended up failing overall, regretted my degree, or just didn't like it? In that case, my money would be lost, and I would probably end up in debt. 

But I should be ok, right? It’s not like I’m going to school for 8 years to become a doctor in Harvard University or a private expensive college. It’s a  public research university that interests me is located not far from my house. 

My parents have high expectations of me going to school, I don’t want to disappoint them but I also don’t won’t put them or myself in a financial disaster either.

I will also tell you I had a math brilliant STEM kid, high stats, deep ECs go to a flagship U due to finances.  He graduated last year in 4 years with 2 full degrees.  He gradauted in the top 5% of his class, inducted into the appropriate honor society on campus.  Due to covid, he was ready for a school break.  Got a job making 6 figures next to a bunch of elite grads.  Not only that, he had such a great UG experience filled with nerdy fun and friends and crazy growth, and amazing personal opportunities.  Other smart and capable kids are making the same choices.  Keep in mind 1/4 of their student body are above their stats.  On a big campus that is a lot of people.  And some of those people without those stats?  Find their groove and their gifts in a college envirnoment.

I 100% get how hard it feels in the middle of this decision.  We have absolutely no regrets.  This kid may turn around and go to grad school in a year or 2 and truly the sky is the limit.  The kids graduating on top with him have moved on to grad school at Princeton, Northwestern, etc etc etc.

You are also setting the tone for younger kids.  You would need to cosign for that debt.  You should never cosign on something you couldn't pay on.  Don't give one kid an opportunity you couldn't give all kids.  You made the same choice yourself and proved it made no difference for a motivated.  My spouse and I were first gen and were educated at a public U.  We both had ""elite"" career paths and it gave us the financial flexibility for me to move to more at home and contract work.

If you need more encouragement, go read what over 100K in debt looks like at r/StudentLoans   I know others who got no where with these FA offices in similar circumstances.

I've went to a preview day and I had fun so I started the process to go there 

However that is when I finally got my acceptance letter and a scholarship for 18,000/yr

Mercer is (on average) 61,000 not counting what FAFSA and GFFSA could do, compared to Gwinnett and 16,000

And my family doesn't have that money meaning I probably will have student loan debt

5217,t1_l1am9ib,1714098975.0,"Going way back (Class of 88), being well-rounded was a good thing. The SAT was much more common than the ACT. Some Midwestern state schools accepted the ACT, but it was kind of an afterthought. The SAT was important as of course test-optional was extremely rare. 1400 was a very good score. My guess is that the 1400 percentile was about the same as 1550 now. I was a National Merit Finalist and don’t recall my PSAT which of course is what it was based on, but I do remember I got a 1390 SAT, so that gives you an idea of what a good standardized test taker received and I was happy with it. The scale shifted for a while after my time, but like now, 1600 was the max. However iirc like 50 people nationwide got that score. Test prep services were just starting then so I am sure that has improved scores now, but I do think also the questions were more difficult then. Analogies was a type of question on the verbal section then, so the test itself was different. The really good schools were pretty much the same with Ivy League, Stanford and such though some state schools have really risen. UNC where I went was really good then too, but UF was my in-state safety and the UF application was like half a page. I remember Berkeley was thought of as good, but UCLA wasn’t particularly amazing. As far as applications, there was no Common App of course and each app was a specific paper form the school mailed to you that had to be typed with a typewriter. Partially for that reason, I applied to just five schools. Acceptance rates were much higher of course, but the application pools were probably stronger for the selective schools. With the forms, it was too much work to shotgun schools and only really strong students even dared apply to top schools. Now that I sound like an old man 😂🤣, it was different, but not as different as you might think. People were impressed if you got into an Ivy League school. I went a private prep school with a college counseling department and spending lots of time on developing an attractive profile and application with ECs, essays etc was a thing like now (except like I said above, well-rounded was almost better than having a spike).",2024-04-25 22:36:15

That's the best part of a massive state school: there's a community for anyone because they tend to be more diverse. I've made a lot of close friends in those communities. And the class sizes get smaller as you progress through your major. I overlooked the pros of a large school's size, as well. You can easily make a big school feel small but you can't do the opposite (make a small school feel big).

I was admitted to BU CGS and SUNY Binghamton(in state). Each of those are around $20k. Muhlenberg would be around $14k. Which would you choose?

I want to do economics or engineering, I was admitted to Bing for econ at Harpur, and for CGS I am of course, undecided.  My plan for CGS is a dual major or major/minor of econ/physics.

For Muhlenberg, I would do ECON and Physics. Most of the colleges I applied to were LACs, BU being one of the only exceptions. A SLAC was what I wanted originally, but BU’s prestige and location is tempting.

Ik there might be a lot of these types of posts. I am simply a senior looking for advice particular to my situation. I'd appreciate any honest advice from anyone out there.

I have to choose a university in 2 weeks. I'm a senior in hs.

I'm deciding between my state school, which has a strong premed program and pipeline into med school vs. CMU for CS.

both schools cost the same after finaid/scholarships/instate tuition consideration.

I am currently super confused about going to cmu to study cs rn. I like many people am unsure about the market. I don't wanna get stuck working a shitty job with low pay, even if that sounds pretentious, it's the truth. I am a decent programmer/STEM student, USACO gold, national chem olympiad and qualified for AIME twice (mid-high tier awards in stem), but i don't know even if i work hard that i will be able to get a 6 figure job when i graduate based on the current market trends.

at my state school, I can't minor/major in cs due to it being too rigorous (too many gpa killing classes) to do with premed, but if for some reason i change my mind to go into cs i can always go for a masters and leetcode or whatever the market will require at that time if its worth it. At cmu, 100% premed isnt an option.

so confused rn. my family wants me to play it safe and go med. im 50/50 personally and although i find aspects of CS super interesting, again, don't wanna get stuck with a dwindling field. i cant help but be pessimistic regarding all the stuff related to job offshoring, AI and the exponentially increasing number of ppl entering the industry.

UMN Twin Cities: 

Pros:

I like the weather significantly more than texas (raised in the midwest so I actually prefer the cold and snow)

Significantly higher ranked than UTD

Active party scene/social life 

Big 10 sports, has a football team andmarching band (which I would like to participate in), lots of school spirit

Bigger student population

Have some friends from high school that are also going here

Cons:

More expensive (30k more per year even with in-state tuition)

Not as much guidance/help for med school admissions

&amp;#x200B;

UT Dallas:

Pros:

Free (full ride scholarship through national merit)

Automatic Honors College admission (also through national merit)

Great med school advising (80% med school admit rate)

Cons:

Lack of school spirit/ big sporting events

weather (this is a big one for me as i'm not used to the heat at all)

lower ranked

minimal to no party scene, have to look a lot harder for social events.

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

Overall I think they're both great options for me. The gist of it is that I logically think that UTD is the better choice because of the scholarship I have there and the fact that it's pretty good for pre-med students. Emotionally though I feel like UMN would be the better choice because of the ""traditional college experience"" which is something I was really hoping for in college. I think that I would be happier at minnesota but the logical and economical choice is dallas.

As for cost, I am very grateful that my parents are willing to pay for my education and they will support any final decision I make. That being said, they have made it clear that price is still a factor and as far as I can tell, they would rather I choose UTD because of my scholarship.

5311,t3_1cdcce1,1714105550.0,"I am curious what your list of most underrated colleges are in America, because I (43M) have a 13 year old son who is autistic, but high achieving. During his time at elementary school until we moved to a bigger house in late 2022 in 6th grade, he got straight A's except in English/PE. Even though his English grades hovered between A-/B+ since 5th grade, it has significantly improved from a C+/B- when he was in 1st grade. During elementary school, he was even in advanced math (one grade level ahead), got straight A in that class, and he also won some school/district wide awards in STEM. He has won a district wide math award, a regional engineering award, as well as win the school's Geography Bee. Despite the fact he only took one advanced course, he was 2-4 grade levels ahead, often using the supplementary books we bought for him to learn and he finished these books in a matter of weeks. Even though we are totally fine with him attending community college, ever since he was 7, he has been dreaming of attending HYPSM universities, knowing that many of the people he aspire to such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Larry Ellison attended some of those top schools. During my son's free time, he loves to watch tech videos, science/history documentaries, learn computer programming (Java, C++, C, Python, Swift, Kotlin, Go, Ruby, R, etc), and explore around with technology and computers. He has been infatuated with computers since he was 5 and would spend hours tinkering around with technology. We even hired a piano tutor for him and even though the piano tutor mostly helps with his fingers/notation, he has self taught and memorized some pieces such as Claire De Lune, Arabesque, Waltz No 7, Grande valse brillante, Moonlight Sonata 1st/2nd movement, Mozart Fantasy No 4, and Schubert Impromptu Op 90 no 2 in a matter of months or even weeks. In Summer of 2022, he even won a piano competition in Boston. Even though we don't pressure him, he is very self motivated and wanted to be at the pinnacle.

After starting online school and moving to my uncle and aunt's house in Quincy in February 2023 because he wanted to push himself further, he started with the 2nd half of 6th grade and 7th grade math at an online self paced school he wanted to attend to try to accelerate his education and by mid-April, he started the 7th grade and Algebra. By mid-August, he finished that and took a month break, travelling to Europe (Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Ljubljana, Salzburg, and Munich) with my uncle (78M) and aunt (76F). In October, he started 8th grade and took Geometry/Algebra II and even though he got straight A, his English grades actually did improve to an A- at the online school, and by mid-January, he started the 9th grade as well as Pre-Calculus while waiting for his 65k private school to answer to him. My uncle and aunt is also talking to the online school about allowing his 9th grade credits to transfer (he does take some courses at a local community college in the meantime to make himself more competitive and to help those transfer as 9th grade credits). I have heard that my son is looking at SAT content and doing some practice problems for the SAT, looking up AP courses he will take during 10th grade like AP World History, AP Calculus BC, AP Computer Science A, AP Chemistry, AP Physics C, AP French, etc, and he is also looking at the possibility of taking Multivariable Calculus and Linear/Abstract Algebra in alter years. He has also thought about joining several STEM related clubs at the new school and joining the student government at his future school, and is considering hard on AMC 12, currently working on some AMC 12 problems as well as looking up IMO, USACO, USAPhO, USNCO, as well as Intel's ISEF.

However, in my opinion, the most underrated college is MCPHS, where my wife went (both in Boston and in Worcester). It seems like there are many people who hate MCPHS despite the fact in my opinion, it is underrated because it doesn't get the respect it deserves. My wife went there between 1999 and 2003 as an international student (first in Boston and then in the Worcester campus), became a nurse, and is now a nurse manager, making 6 figures. I however, went to Northeastern in 1999 before transferring over to WPI in 2000.

According to MCPHS website, it said it is the highest paying and the most transformative school and the best value and mobility as well, but people keep on complaining and hating it. If MCPHS is bad, then the one guy wouldn't have chosen MCPHS. From what I heard, there is a guy who chose MCPHS for molecular biology over BU, BC, and UConn because MCPHS has good mentoring opportunities. If MCPHS wasn't good, then people wouldn't go there, but many people go there and are relatively successful, especially in Massachusetts because a lot of my coworkers went to MCPHS and are either managers or directors at my biotech company.

In my opinion, even though I went to Northeastern, WPI, and then grad school at University of Houston, I do believe that MCPHS is not only easy to get into compared with other universities with lower social mobility like BU, Northeastern, and of course, Harvard and MIT, they are also very diverse, have a lot of great alumni, is a feeder to many medical and dental schools because I knew of a former MCPHS Boston student (one of my wife's colleagues) who went on to become a director of a medical department at Mass General, has good mentoring opportunities, the best professors, and high graduation rate.",2024-04-26 00:25:50

5320,t3_1cdceii,1714105767.0,"Please help me decide between Northeastern, Drexel, and maybe ASU as an aspiring and current entrepreneur. Thank you so much!

Drexel: received 25K in merit, whereas at Northeastern I received none but there is only 1 co-op where at Northeastern I'd be able to do 2 co-ops (graduating in 4 years). I'm an entrepreneurship major and plan to minor in something (possibly marketing, cybersecurity, sports management, etc.) I'd also consider an Information Systems major switch as I know it pays better for co-ops.  
Drexel pros: Amazing entrepreneurship resources, professors, funding opportunities etc. In the city of Philly which is great for work opportunity, entrepreneurship, etc. Students seem chill and hardworking. Cons: much worse campus than Northeastern and ASU, not as much school spirit, weird quarter system, not as prestigious as Northeastern. Entrepreneurship school is very small but tight knit. Also I'm not sure about social life

Northeastern: Received no merit. Got into Global Scholars program so I go to Oakland for a semester and London for a semester. Pros: Beautiful campus, get to travel, amazing co-op program, Boston is an amazing city, excellent resources and reputation. Cons: Costs 25K more than Drexel per year (because at Drexel I received merit). Would likely take out loans (possibly 7K per year)

ASU: Pros: Costs significantly less, beautiful weather, great entrepreneurship program, great business rank, beautiful campus, Phoenix is an amazing city. Cons: Far from home as I live on Northeast, Bad reputation (at least in the Northeast among people I've talked to although I know it has a solid professional reputation.)

5339,t1_l1b47j1,1714107203.0,"If he’s planning to be an engineer, going to an IVY will open up more doors. I know many people say that “schools arent all that” or “jobs don’t care” is simply not true. I’m a computer science student and I know several companies in California area that will only hire from Stanford, or only hire from USC, or only hire from top rated schools. Going to an IVY league just opens doors so much easier and he could definitely learn so much from his peers there and network with amazing people. U of A he would definitely not only have to learn how to get out there, how to connect with people, he would have to work much harder to get those opportunities. Especially since private schools are very tight knit, the professors actually help the students, students help eachother. Huge public schools have very little relationships with the staff and often it’s hard to reach out to programs and other things that are readily accessible but pushed out in a private school. 

However if he plans on being a researcher or a professor he’s much better off doing it debt free, google pays its software engineers 250k a year but paying off debt on a professors or a research salary sounds like a waste of money. 

Overall I think you can make it anywhere, as long as you try hard enough but the only reason your debating this decision is because your making the choice between graduating debt free or going to a prestigious school and missing out on that opportunity. Keep in mind that college in itself is also expensive, from toiletries, food, spending money on friends, technology, etc. so if you think ur student can end up paying off the debt, I would do it.

My son got an increase in merit aid by submitting his latest transcript that showed more current grades than they had (they were continued good grades) and that he’s taking hard classes, pointing out his commitment to his studies. He also showed his merit aid from other schools and explained that this school was the most expensive he was considering. He wrote a little letter/paragraph that went along with his appeal explaining that stuff, and they did bump his merit aid up a bit. 

Talk to the financial aid office and they can probably give you some tips. There may be a page on the school’s site for appeals, there was on this one but it wasn’t super obvious. We got the link during a financial aid webinar.
