2567,"i’d caution against claiming your professor is discriminating on the grounds of you being white. not only will the administration likely do nothing, but i would agree if they didn’t take your claim seriously. as a white person, i don’t believe this is racism. i seriously doubt she “fiercely hates white people” - i have black professors who speak against racism, white supremacy, etc who i get along with well. from how they talk, you might think they hate white people, but hating “whiteness” as a construct isn’t the same as hating white people. unless there’s been some indication your grades are a result of racism (e.g. your professor makes racially insensitive comments in class, grades white students at large unfairly poorly, etc.) this won’t go anywhere. even if you think your work is “higher level” your opinion might be biased, and might lack insight a professional artist (your professor) would have.

444,"you're just out of practice.  

my advice: start practicing relating to people that you don't fear rejection from.  it's easy to get intimidated by our peers and think they are so much cooler when we feel inadequate, boring, etc. so challenge yourself to strike up conversations with uber drivers, waiters, baristas, people in line, on the bus, etc. who cares if they think you're boring or obnoxious or ridiculous? the point is to practice opening yourself up. so when you do approach people on campus it feels more natural. just ask a random off-handed question ""you seem to know where everything is, how long have you been working here?"" ""what would you recommend?"" ""what name do you get the most? (starbucks barista always writes names)"" ""sorry to bother you, i'm trying to decide between ______ and ______ (movie), have you seen either?"" don't start with your name or hi just throw something out for them to remark on and let it flow. hell volunteer at an old folks home and share some love. they're dying (literally) for conversation and have super cool stories they want to tell before they go and wouldn't judge you in the least as you gain your footing. when your confidence grows then try it on campus. 

and secondly, be genuinely interested in getting to know other people and not just making a friend if that makes sense. when you have an agenda it comes through and is off-putting. forget the end desire and just show interest in others instead of concentrating on who you lack and how you feel. when people feel seen they are more appreciative of you and inclusive and in turn reciprocate by giving attention back. ask them questions about themselves and remark on answers.

do you think maybe you are overdoing it? why do you give so much to every friendship? do you think those people wouldn't be your friend if you didn't give?

i think if you want a friend that you can have that super close and caring connection with, you should pick a single friend and really focus on spending time with them and getting to know them, maybe even at the cost of some of your relationships with other people. you don't have to give to all of your friends because a lot of friendships aren't ones where people really expect to give or take, they are surface level. if you want a give and take friendship, you've really got to invest into one person to make them care about you.

the rep said there has been white students who have joined and transferred over to a hbcu and they didn’t have any issues. they joined teams, clubs, and were accepted amongst their peers.

now, i will state this; 
with knowing that this is hbcu, i’d would be mindful of the history of the college and what it represents. be open to different viewpoints and perspectives. i’ll give you an example of a similar situation to yours;

have you heard of the university gallaudet university? it is university for the deaf and hard of hearing population in washington. while a large percentage of the student pop is d/hoh, they don’t deny the entrance of hearing students. they welcome them too. just be mindful of the environment, history, and culture (language) of the school you are going to serves a particular population historically and culturally. 

i’d say; if that school was aware of you being non-poc and still offered and gave you the scholarship, then they are saying you are welcomed to be there. in addition to what you said about the culture shock; well think of it for many poc (and by my example of d/hoh people) in the overall world and academic/ work environment. being exposed to the realities others face could be beneficial if you can recognize that. and well, again, others have been forced to do the exact same thing time and time again. 

as a biracial person, it might be easier for me to say this and might be harder for you to handle due to this. however, i will reenforce that they gave you the scholarship knowing who you are. don’t let people stop you cuz it may be uncomfortable (unless it crosses the line of being reasonable)- if you are ok and willing to be put in this situation and learn from a hbcu; then go and be open to learn",0.2215395102486845
1536,"i'm 42. i have seen things change. if it makes you feel any better (it won't), you have ai on your radar right now, but there are lots of other things that can make jobs obsolete and you simply cannot know the future. i do not mean to be condescending in any sense, however my guess is you are young and haven't really been in the workforce and you simply have no idea about how adult life is. now you are fixated on ai because its a tangible fear you can grasp abd understand right now. all of your feara about life are kinda getting put onto ai. ai isn't the problem...your big scary unknown future is the problem.

what you should plan on is having skills and getting your first job. from there you just stumble on. data analysis and being able to use applications effectively is still very important and valuable.


you are waay waaay more likely to lose a job due to c levels being greedy, acqusitions and mergers, or offshoring than you are to lose it to ai in any job (other than writing and artists who are getting wrecked by ai now).

 accountants and finance people aren't being replaced by ai (i know many). people still value human brainpower in many places. yes this could change and probably is changing right now somewhat but you literally cannot do anything about that. everything about the way society works could change. i'm sorry if i am giving you an existential crisis, but life is kinda like that. you just keep on going and adapt. you will not graduate with something that is ""100%"" useless.

most people do not work in the field of their major. most people, you ask them,will tell you they have no idea how they made it ""this far"" in life. you think they are just being humble? as a 42 year old, nope. this is the truth. you just wake up, make small decisions daily and bam you ""end up"" with some wildly different life than you thought you would.

life has a way of just throwing you for loops despite your plans. 

for all you know you'll end up working in ai in the future. 

don't worry about ai. worry about the randomness of life.

check my weird path out:  undergrad: photography and poliical science. grad: creative writing in fiction. current job: owner of a toy store. previois job: video game designer. not to mention how i ended up getting married and living where i do now. i couldn't have predicted or imagined any of it. 

take the opportunities you get. breathe. we are all in a fog of war stumbling through. all of us. even the ones who look like they got their shit together run into situations they are not prepared for or knowledegable about.

being an adult is knowing you don't know everything, can't control everything and are willing to ask for help and advice when you are in the dark. this is why mechanics, accountants, lawyers, finance people, and market analysis folks are valuable. they are the ones the rest of us go to when we are in the dark and need help. this is why they are valuable. i would absolutely lose my shit if any of them somehow switched to ai. maybe they will in the future but i am certainly not living my life with that contingency in the forefront of my mind or letting it affect my daily life.

artists and writers of all kinds, i think, are the ones genuinely getting decimated by ai at this moment and it is a real problem for them

1492,"a confrontation makes it about them.  pointing out something negative about their behavior will cause social tension and create drama where there shouldn't be any. ducking them will too. 

so deal with it head on in a way that's about you, having healthy boundaries. something that doesn't require a big show about or talk over with people. if they send a message that seems pissy or agitated, reply simply: ""i'm sorry if you feel neglected. i wish i had more time to help you, but i've realized i've spread myself too thin helping so many people at the cost of my own learning. it's overwhelming me. 

then a last sentence that is some throw out 
""i saw they have free tutoring in (bldg) on (days) and (time)""
or ""there's a study group that meets at (all details) i know of, if you want to join""

don't say anything more than that, don't get pulled into a conversation about it's just one question and they're just one person. if they persist point out you're just one person and have just one responsibility: to make decisions that are good for you. and understand if after you point out you are overwhelmed by the task of helping everyone they still push you to put their needs above yours and don't respect your boundaries - they aren't friends. be willing to let go of users to find a better social circle.

though you'll find most people aren't assholes that intend to take you for granted....they just push forward for their own interests unless checked by boundaries. if you have no boundaries with them how do they know when they're breaking them? people with the strongest, clearest boundaries are ones that are the most respected in a group and successful in life.",0.21199957600127198

the one rule that i stick to is to be open and honest about everything. seriously. everything. if it seems small and insignificant, talk about it. discuss overnight guests, sleeping habits, noise levels, chores, cleanliness, food, boundaries, pet peeves, everything. i know this might seem weird or awkward to do, but this will help sooooo much, i promise. get to know them as people, it will make everything easier. 

psychologically speaking, you think differently than they do, so it’s going to be an adjustment when you interact with them on a daily basis in your shared home. from experience, they usually don’t notice things that seem obvious, especially things that can cause problems or that bother other people. just talk to them, you will get used to them, and them to you. 

hopefully you get to a place where you all become really good friends, it’s the best! i have seen many people advise people in your situation not to date your roommates; i am someone who is dating one of my roommates so i obviously have opinions about this. i’m not encouraging you, nor am i against it. if you decide to date one of them, you need to be completely sure that you want to date this person long term. you would be taking a huge risk, and this will cause issues in your home. be very careful, not only with the guy you might date, but the others as well. again, communication is important here.

2474,"cc, the honors programs when i was in one was based on act/sat scores. not necessarily high school gpa.

my hs grades sucked senior year, but i still got into honors history and english because i rocked the act.

you should be fine and there's lots of reasons to do poor in hs. sucky teachers that don't like you, life drama, all sorts of things. mine was that i hated my hs and started just not giving a shit. horrible people. teachers that did not like me, and spending a lot of time exploring relationships, jobs, evetual independence,  etc and letting that take priority.

ds and cs still pass for hs, though. that's the important thing where you get the hs diploma.

you will still get in and most likely be able to dorm with your friend if they put all honors people into separate honors dorms. if not, so what? you will still get in. you'll just meet new people. which can be cool to a degree.

bear in mind, though about college.

college flunks out around half the people that attend it. more or less depending on what you get into. and there's a good chance what you think you want to go into, you will change your mind.

the good thing is unlike hs, it's not every single day. but it's a lot more compact  and if you don't keep on top, it sneaks up on you. especially if you are on your own with little oversight and let the party and dating scene or jobs get in the way. this is what happened to me my first attempt of college back in the day. partied, dated, worked till too many missing 8 am algebra classes and a string of fs and ds led to the end of my college career until decades later.",0.20628424925175867

other things to try: 
*become an ra in your dorm 
*sign up with admissions to be the campus rep/tour guide for transfers
*volunteer somewhere nearby...girls like puppies so it's a good place to start
*find a geekswhodrink trivia night at a bar nearby (you don't have to drink) and ask to join a group ""i'm a transfer student and don't know anyone yet, mind if i join your group?"" you'll probably be invited to join the week after. 
*join an intermural sport: flag football, kickball, sand volleyball, softball. sign up and they put free agents on teams 
*take your work to a coffeeshop...find one with longer community tables that you have to share with someone 
*use your question of what to do in this thread as your reason for approaching people at your college and around you. ""i just transferred here and don't know anyone, have any social things to recommend where i can meet people? it's super isolating not having my friends at school here, someone to grab a meal/drink.."" or just ""you up for a drink/ grabbing food sometime, i just transfered here and don't know anyone yet..?"" you'll be surprised how people might react. invite you along. take the win. initiate something else a week or two later. 
*go to the fitness rec center. workout it will help with endorphins and lift your mood and give you a segway. find someone in your same weight class/fit type and ask if they're interested in being spotting partners/accountability partners/workout buddies to help the other stay motivated because you've always enjoyed fitness more with a partner. 
*and just watch people. if you stop concentrating on how awkward you feel you'll start noticing others that feel the same way. those are your people. approach them. don't try to blend in with the group of friends that have known each other since kindergarten that's an impossible fortress to penetrate.  (#nonewfriends). 
*find/form a meetup to take a walk in the evenings 

my guess is you're trying too hard and being too formal. and maybe you expect to be turned down so you carry yourself with some tension. relax, smile. a  trick i use to meet people easily and anywhere is to act like we're already in the middle of a conversation and shared secret. at a coffeeshop: (to other person also studying) *let out a big sigh then a smile ""ever feel like the more you study the less you know?"" introduce yourself only after talking back and forth a few times almost off-handed.  in class: (to the person next to you) ""he/she (the professor) had me at _____ but lost me at ______. are you able to stick with it all the way through?!!""  and the thing is you look at them when you start the conversation then look back ahead then back at them to punctuate the question mark.  the focus is the conversation and not them. sometimes formalities can seem awkward and transactional. like the end of a conversation always seems weird how to say bye. so just say ""catch ya later or cheers or see you around"" and leave. though i can understand when you feel super isolated you want a friend so bad but you can't force one to start by magic.  it's about making contact over and over until it gives way to something natural.

i had dropped out of my first attempt at college and went to work in the service industry in the new orleans french quarter. nothing to do but 24 hour bars and that's how people socialized.

""they"" say it's the thing to do where all the socialization happens and the cute girls go, but it really is over hyped.

my reasons?

* it's expensive even if you are only drinking pbr and cheap draft.
* i never really made friends in there.
* i did manage to ""pick up"" or ""get picked up"" and did have a one night stand or three over the years i went, but it was rare and unfulfilling. the better relationships were from online or through social/work networks. and nowadays, people frown on that because both of y'all are too drunk and there's been some embarrassing moments and waking up next to crazy.
* most bars are loud as hell and no meaningful conversations were ever had.
* got tired of felling like shit if i accidentally over drank.
* being too drunk out and about late at night (or anytime really or any place other than the house) is a legal and safety risk.
* while there are older people bars, past 30, this shit is just sad. jumps the shark probably by mid 20s and only marginally worthwhile younger than that.",0.19781414201873604

3274,"   i feel like i am struggling a lot, no, truly, i am. at first everything was sailing smoothly for the most part, all of the frustration from errors was all deserved on my end, such as having a missing grad for my midterm essay because i misses the part where it said it could not be late, and of course that was consciously the one time decision i made to accept a point deduction on a late grade just so i could make sure my formatting was proper for apa and that ny citations where in order, you know why? a previous mistake i made, the first of many i'm sure. i was struggling trying to find out the proper citation formatting for when referring to court and legal cases. 

   the way i process knowledge and new information may be different than most, i like to find a relation to what i'm learning to my everyday life, like if i've had an experience related to that topic or maybe it was something i vaguely remember reading about in 10th grade. i am fully aware and can recognize that yes, there may be times where my writing to the average neurotypical may feel like it's unrelated to the context, but often it is not that far off because typically they understand the overall point of what i'm saying aside from the 3 random sentences of how my brain decided to process and apply this knowledge to something i'm familiar with.

   today after receiving an email from a professor, i feel more frustrated than ever and it feels like i'm being dismissed in a way almost. we had a discussion board of questions that overall related to gender identy and transgender people, like giving examples of how you can be respectful and knowledgeable when interacting with someone who has a different gender identity, identifying things you would probably have in common with a transgender person, and even the impact of social microagressions. clearly, she already had a predetermined answer for a subjective topic. 
   i know the answer she was looking for focused on the mental health aspect of being transgender, the likelihood of depression and how the statistics of suicide rates increase. i know it, my friends know, anyone with common sense knows it. the issue was, i posed a separate issue to this perspective that is often overlooked, which is bodily mutilation, and i don't mean that in a derogatory manner because i support medical transitioning, but the relationship this has is when people have this expectation of how transgender people should look, what they do medically and/or surgically, etc. you are pushing this narrative of how you think it should be.
    the microagressions of invasive questions, asking whether or not someone has had 'the' surgery, that is the reality of it. i had included a link to information about 'safe' phalloplasty procedures, which included images that showed the stages of the surgery. mind you, again, it was a link and i didn't just upload a bunch of graphic images in my text itself, i had also included a note that it was nsfw and graphic, that it a genital based procedure, so there is genitalia, thinking, this is okay because we are all adults and we are grown enough to have serious discussions over these topics, and apparently i was wrong. she told me that the images were graphic and unrelated to the discussion. again, let's remember that i added a note by the link that explicitly stated that there was graphic surgical images but by clicking that link you consensually made that decision to view that.

   i don't feel it comes for an egotistical standpoint that i have to be right or i have to get the last word in, because that's not the case at all. i feel that there is a form of bitter irony here though, considering this is a cultural and ethnic identity class, and we have had assignments to look at our identities, especially as white people, to recognize our white privilege, the stages of racism, how being passive isn't the better solution, and just being able to look at a variety of topics especially in the sense of marginalized groups and communities, but how are you going to go out of your way to tell your only transgender student that this is unrelated, when this is an experience that you have probably never witnessed or are completely unaware of? it felt so dismissive and invalidating to have her email me that, but also didn't quite say what could be better or what to avoid doing. they always just make comments that something went off topic, but they don't give anymore context beyond that and it's frustrating because then i don't understand what i can potentially fix on my end to do better to upholds the neurotypical standard.",0.19590694453450175

no, that is reasonable for a bsn.

bsns even in shithole rural areas at shithole facilities make at least 18-20 straight grad which is 40k. but that is absolute garbage tier worst case and you will either do better or work that for several months and move on and do better. more likely 50-80k. some overpriced, overhyped place like ny/ca 100-180k. even absolute trash tier, you will still make double your investment in 1 year. which is more than what most programs can claim.

bear in mind, though, that nursing school is boot camp and flunks out people and they tell people straight up you can't work and do this. (at least last two years). so have a support network or live cheap/dorms.

i am a 24 year old australian who is looking to move overseas on a gap year, and am looking to focus on relaxing with a bit of adventure. does anyone have any suggestions for things to do? i have heard of people doing a ski season and working there, but am not sure if it is worth it. i have also heard of people just traveling europe but am not sure if it is a little bit too expensive. i am also into sports and would love to improve my surfing ability or any other skill as long as it involves being active. 



any and all responses will be very much appreciated, i have no preferences to countries and am very open to any suggestions. 

for those that have done a gap year what was your experience? if if you had the time back what would you do different?

i simply believe getting caught up in the emotional aspect of politics puts me in a position where i understand the nuances of a situation far less than if i logically understand the stakeholders and reality.

as a kid, i was very jolly, happy and full of life. i had many friends. as recent as my class 10th, i had a nice group of close friends. we did everything together and we are still in contact through socials as we are now in different colleges. so i know how it feels to be in company of nice friends. 

but after 10th, we started studying for competitive exams in our home isolation which was traumatizing and full of taunts and then covid lockdown struck as well and after all of that, the person that i have come out as now, is absolutely opposite to what i was.

when i joined my engineering college in 2021, it was difficult for me to make friends. obviously there were students with different personalities and i couldn't fit in with everyone. i observed everyone for a while and tried networking with a few but it just won't work. they were always close to each other more than me. i always felt ignored and uninvited. leaving my self respect aside, i even tried changing friend groups to feel liked somewhere but nobody includes me with them.

i am not cool like them. i dont drink and smoke. i dont go to parties and clubs. i am already shy and introverted &amp; i think after those two years of isolation, i have also become a serious faced, boring person. and people cannot relate to me anymore. i have no personality.

people around me are having huge friend groups. they are always seen together, talking and laughing. they go out to watch movies and on trips. they have girlfriends and boyfriends who love them and what not. i don't even have a friend circle. i have become a loner.

i really want people to love me and invite me to their plans. i want friends who treat me with respect. who share secrets. who play sports together. who study together. who dont make me feel left out.

and the joke is, i am writing all this, when college is almost about to finish. i am in my 7th sem now. i am writing all this so that i dont f*** up like this after college too. i dont want to become that ""loner"" guy that is just there in some corner doing his work like a donkey.

recently, everyone was moving out of hostels to take an accommodation somewhwere outside college. everyone invited and gathered their friend circle of 4-5 people, and shifted in flats and pgs together. and then there's me. as i had absolutely no friends who i could shift with, i am living in college hostel with some fellow loners. 

i can't believe what i have done to myself. maybe i am a bit old school. maybe i have no idea how to make friends in this generation. please please please give me some genuine tips of what should i change about myself so that people around me includes me in their circle and make me an important part of their life. what kind of person do you all like ? how can i also become a person of priority ?",0.1777046633277277

how did that go? this would have given you some insight into how the professor acts away from a group. sometimes they're much more laid back when they don't have to deal with a whole class when speaking to you.

&gt;during class however, my professor (m) is supposed to give the class 25-30 minutes to critique my piece. without giving too many details (they would likely bore you) my professor saved my work until the last minute and barley said anything.

i've been in a lot of workshop classes like this. this happens all the time, regardless of gender or age. this is a time management and classroom management issue, especially because workshops are 90% discussion. they also tend to run long and people get distracted/antsy/tired.

20 pages per student is a lot. if you have, say, 3 people submitting stories each week, that's 60 pages (if no one goes over or doesn't use formatting that is difficult to read). it can be hard to keep up with. this is why it's better to establish rapport with your classmates and go to office hours so you have some connections beyond the workshop for future feedback.

is there a possibility that you're being treated unfairly? of course. before turning to the department chair/dean, though, consider if there is anything you can do to ask for better time management in the class, ask people if they can write down more notes for you to incorporate into your work (if they have time), try to have a clear but open-minded conversation about this over office hours, and so on. it's possible you're not the only one who feels this way, but you won't know until you start to communicate assertively and try not to put too much stock into anyone's opinion of you.",0.14433756729740643

3487,"i don't know much about vr, but if you're going to college, you may want to expand you social circle and social life at least somewhat to include people in real life, like classmates and people in your dorm. college naturally has a lot of social interaction, and you will probably enjoy it more if you made friends and did social activities on campus rather than go to class and back to your room to be in vr. obviously don't just disappear on your vr friends, but many highs school friendships fade in college anyway as people start to find their own way in life and grow in different directions. i would imagine vr has limited directions to grow in, so make an effort to maintain some contact essentially but don't try to hold onto those friendships so tight that you limit your ability to make friends at school.

also - social interaction and building relationships are important life skills that you will definitely need in life, and college is a great time to learn and refine those skills. these are soft skills you can't learn from a book or class - like empathy, conflict resolution, active listening, various forms of communication, assertiveness, reading the room, mirroring, coping skills, arguing, non-verbal communication, boundary setting, etc., and your own style of applying these skills. these are things that come from experience and practice and especially form exposure to a variety of different types of people so you can learn what you do and do not want from others in relationships and how to meet others' needs as well. (books can help guide you, but you have to apply what you read in real life settings). it's not to say you don't get some of this in vr relationships, but it's not the same. plus 80% of communication is non-verbal like body language, body tone, facial expressions, etc., so if you aren't learning how to use and understand non-verbal cues well, you may not be a good communicator in a lot of situations.

not to mention, the connections you make in college often help you later in life at jobs, networking, etc. if you take vr, i'd suggest limiting your time there and focusing on being present for the whole college experience.",0.1408939907352694

i’m not encouraging you to take on more debt, but i would encourage you to look into programs funded by the government. hopefully something will offer more pay than you are currently finding. a number of my peers had a ton of funding via government for additional education that i wish i had known about. also, get networking. networking is so so important and it also lets you know what other opportunities are out there to take advantage of. it may even secure new jobs for you.

it's possible they are leaving you out of things intentionally, because your former roommates no longer feel that you are a member of the core friend group, but it's also possible they are discussing plans in person, verbally, and it doesn't occur to them to separately invite you along.  

i suggest you try to maintain a friendship with the specific members of this group whom you are closest to. invite them to lunch one on one, or ask them if they want to join a club with you, or a rec sports team. you can't force the whole group of five or six other people to include you in all of their social plans, but you can build a close friendship with specific individuals by being proactive and asking them to do things with you.

unfortunately, it's complicated and perpetuating series of historical happenings... i'm oversimplifying/generalizing here, and it's likely tldr.

going to college was once a sign of accomplishment/affluence. 

almost all parents yearned for their kids to go to college to better themselves and land better jobs.

for a while it was basically guaranteed that going to college would get you paid more.

more people went to college. higher ed industry grew. you start to see more for-profit colleges with easier access and bigger promises. 

more colleges fighting for students to buy in. standards lowered. entry is easier. finding money to go gets easier, but more devious.

parents expect their kids to go to college as a normal occurrence. many students feel they have to go. higher ed gets saturated and financially prosperous. 

having a college degree isn't special in the workplace anymore. harder for recent grads to stand out in a crowded job market. 

big economic crash.

recently graduated students start to realize that all that free money wasn't actually free. crippling debt on top of economic downturn. 

major life events postponed - buying a home, having kids...

the debt and impact on lives causes people to question the value of education.  is it worth all the debt and despair?

higher ed industry sees the questioning and doubles down on making college easier to get into by further lowering standards both to get in and to stay in. 

for many educators, academic rigor is forcibly replaced by the ""customer is always right"" academia, fueled by bottom lines.

the value of higher ed is questioned even more due to even lower standards and further economic problems. 

online education grows as a cheaper alternative to residential education. many start to see this as the better choice. you start to see questionable value, online-only, take your money and run colleges pop up.

value questioned even more.

big problem incoming. in no small part due to economic downturn, people are having fewer children. this translates into fewer college-age students available. that cliff is coming. 

colleges need to pivot to being even more accessible to start relevant and competitive in the saturated market. ""everything's flexible and negotiable"" in higher education. we need to cater to our customer's needs and wants.

pandemic hits. shit gets real. it affects us horribly. all of us, students, staff, faculty... life gets really hard for a lot of people.

pandemic forcibly accelerates online education on colleges. do or die. academics now cater to the individual needs of each student. ultimate flexibility and unrestricted ""understanding"" becomes the norm. 

we're all going through some stuff. everyone - rightfully so - tries to take it easier on each other. everyone gets an a because of the situation.

we got used to netflix, doordash, zoom... never leaving the house but having everything on-demand. consume. i bet i can be a content creator. look it up on youtube.  what do i even need college for?

we all physically come back from the time away, but some of us never truly come back. we like it easier. we still got graded/paid the same for doing less. i don't want to go to work. can't i just...

post-pandemic, the economy changed. things are more expensive. 

but we still want it our way, immediately, and as cheaply as possible.

higher ed has a money problem. no one wants to pay sticker prices for college. more financial aid! make entry simpler. cater! pander! satisfy! retain!

education, served like burger king: have it your way. give them what they want when they want it. do it all, now. yesterday. anticipate every individuals' needs. give them everything you have, day and night.

but cut costs everywhere.  resources dwindling. incoming classes are smaller. is the ship sinking? faculty leaving for higher-paying jobs. 

admin not replacing them to lower the budgets. spread the work around to the rats left on the ship. oh but there's no additional pay. no, we can't do raises this year. for the good of the cause!

faculty: what am i doing?

student: why should i care? 

staff: please don't fire me. 

parent: why does my child have an f?

administration: what can we do to pass this student?

and now here we are. education is kinda fucked up. 

it's a product of us. we did this.

there are a lot of good, honest, passionate, hard-working people on every side of this - students, staff, faculty, admin. great people that actively resist the generalizations i put forth here. 

but there's so many who have given in to bottom-line, basic, burger king education.  for some, it's the only way they survive. for others, it's just easier.

advise for you for as you continue on in your academic journey:
1. as others have stated, talk with your academic advisor on campus. if you aren’t close to them or have a difficult time reaching them (as that does happen sometimes) reach out to the advising department and see if you can be assigned a new advisor who might be easier to reach and meet with.
2. most students connect with at least one instructor as they get further into their degree plan (junior and senior year is when the major concentration classes really start after those general electives are all taken care of). instructors, especially in your major concentration, can be great people to talk about career goals and get ideas of what path you might need to take while still being in school. they may even know of some opportunities that you could get involved in that would help you later on as well.
3. reach out to the student services department or special programs like career services, personal and career counseling or even trio student support services if your school has one. these people are all specially trained and work with students on a daily basis helping them as they look at the workforce after college.

3318,"i'm sorry that you are having a tough time and that you feel like your experiences are being invalidated. one downside of courses like these is that they often assume no one in the course is actually from the minority group being discussed and assignments can be written in a way that alienate actual minorities.

although i am not your instructor, perhaps i can shed a little light on why this may be happening--though, you should always follow up with your instructor, asking if they can clarify their exact expectations. i'm just going with what i assume happened.

i teach literature and often cover texts that have issues concerning gender, race, class, etc. and i have discussion questions on how the text handles those issues. it's not uncommon for a student to talk about the social issue in general, but not *how the text deals with it*. for example, we'll cover a text that deals with gender--but doesn't mention motherhood--and i have students write about how women were expected to do nothing but have babies.  it's not that this is a bad or totally irrelevant point in the larger scheme of gender roles--but that's not what we're focusing on, so it's not the time to comment that. for many instructors, the point of discussion questions is largely so the professor can evaluate how well you're engaging with the materials in the class itself.

it sounds like something like this may have happened. your instructor was expecting engagement with the main talking points of the course, and you brought in a subject that was related, but not reflective of the course itself. the topic of surgery, how it's done, etc., are related to the topic of transgenderism--but it's not what your course is about. discussions of the surgery, it's safety, etc., do not show you understand the concepts of the class itself. as for the images themselves, i do think it is important to remember that many people are sensitive to surgical images. your instructor needs to check the link you provided in order to fully grade your post. so even if you warn that it's nsfw, they have to check it whether they want to see that kind of stuff or not.

this may sound contradictory, but in the future don't think of your discussion posts as *discussions*. discussions involve bringing in new perspectives and generally related info. instead, think of them more like reports.

so instead of saying ""microaggressions can be related to issues concerning surgery. here's some more info on surgery so you understand why this is such a big deal"" you might say something like ""microaggressions can be related to issues concerning surgery. here's why it is a microaggression to ask if someone has had surgery. i can empathize with this because people talking about my body would make me uncomfortable."" if you're openly trans in the class you may instead say something about why you wouldn't ask other trans people about their surgery status, or you might say ""here's why cisgender people can relate to this: they also would be uncomfortable if someone asked them about their bodies."" it's more boring and less conversational to write it this way, but it's showing you can mirror the ideas of the class back at the instructor. 

again, check with your instructor for further feedback. you may ask if they can give you feedback on your next post before you make it. don't be afraid to ask follow up questions if you don't understand their feedback.",0.11423909559550796

seeing how you have some similar circumstances, discuss it with your parents. see what their expectations are. for me, it was start paying rent once i graduate and land a job asap. if you have some more support, use that and save up. many people take loans so they can afford college, so don’t feel bad. they say turn to fafsa, i say turn to your state as well. i was able to get some grants from them that fafsa didn’t, it was great! and don’t feel bad about cc either. you can always transfer and it saved me tens of thousands.get involved, enjoy it, and don’t let a relationship hold you back!!! that’s what i did and lost that, as well as the time i waisted putting my future in it.

2543,"recently, i have faced racism and discrimination in my direction. i moved from russia to the usa in 2021. although i graduated from college there with a 4.0 gpa, i had to graduate from high school in america to be able to go to university. but, my grades at the university refuse to be accepted, so i have to take a lot of low-level classes in order not to waste time and money. at the moment, i have to take 9 lessons in total, both at the university and at the community college. the situation is just happening at glendale community college, where i have to take the lowest drawing class. 

from the very beginning, my teacher seemed strange to me because of his statements and ""creativity"", because, to be honest, my teacher has a very low level of qualification and drawing. but i turned a blind eye to it, because i only need this class for evaluation. i handed over all the work on time and followed the instructions clearly, but they started to greatly underestimate my grades. just like that, but at the same time trying to find some minor mistakes that were not even written in the task, and some were simply sucked out of the finger. although, comparing the students' work, mine turn out to be of a higher level, just because i have an education already and extensive work and drawing experience, i'm not trying to offend anyone. but for some reason, almost all students get excellent grades, when my score is now 73%. 

to be honest, i didn't understand what was going on at all, i tried to talk to her, but she just stopped answering me. i was trying to find why she is doing that until i found out a couple of very interesting interviews that were taken from my teacher as an ""artist"". and the truth was revealed to me. she just fiercely hates white people, which is not even hidden in her statements. all of her work is based on hatred of whites and the rise of the black race. as a person who has not lived all his life in america, i absolutely cannot understand why she was angry at me, lol, i don't even have anything to do with all this movement. perhaps my work offended her in some way, because one of my creative assignments came out on a political topic - and she underestimated it the most, but is this a reason for such an attitude towards students? 

i also tried to check the professor on rate my professor, but it turned out that almost all the negative reviews about her were deleted, but there was a moment that she attacked her students on social networks, as well as that she always gives a lot of extra credit to works, but for some reason she categorically refuses to give them to me. due to the fact that these courses are held online, it is difficult to understand what kind of experience other students have. 

there is a lot to talk about this, but i will move on to the main issue of my post. what should be done in such situations? should i try to keep trying to talk to the teacher who stopped answering my questions, or contact the college administration right away? i really care about my grades tho and i've done too much for some low-level teacher to ruin my entire academic record.",0.10727978097782272

i was stunned honestly because it’s 2024 and i’ve only had positive feedback from everyone in my life. i’ll admit, i was a bit nervous to tell my parents because i was afraid they’d think i was making a huge financial mistake, but they were thrilled! 

overall, i think there are still enough mean/rude/crappy people out there who do talk negatively about people starting school late or “starting over,” that many people are afraid of backlash and judgment. but all of that judgment only comes from people who hate their own lives (even subconsciously…) and so it makes them feel better about their own lives. for example, “i know i hate my job and i might’ve even picked the wrong career, but i make bank and at least i’m not that old person having a midlife crisis and going back to school when i’m 30 or 40 or 50…i mean, that has to suck more than my life right now, right? that’s admitting you’ve failed, and i haven’t failed because i have the house, car, and job title to prove it!” 

the person who insulted me also assumed i had failed my first career. it was quite the contrary. i was burned out and killing myself every day after 20 years of the same shite day in and day out. i needed a massive change and i’ve honestly never been happier! 

i’m broke…very broke, (before i decided to go back to school i was spending money carelessly because it was the only way i felt better after work every day. so my savings got depleted pretty fast after quitting and starting school. but i’m so happy. the “being broke” part was what scared me the most, because i was way too attached to money and had been willing to give my life up (literally) for it. not any more. but i had to take that leap of faith to realize it’s not as bad as i remember. it sucks having to choose between medical tests or food…or whether you can afford the gas to visit home to help your parents with a family crisis, but it’s still truly worth it. i just needed to remember that to shake me out of my old pattern and habits. 

turned into a novel here but ultimately, the above reasons are why insecurity exists. because naysayers are too scared to take a leap of faith themselves and push their own fears on others. “i could never go back to school at our age. my brain is fried and i’d fail every test i bet…” (one of the nicer naysayer examples lol) or worse, “are you sure you can afford that? how are you gonna make rent if you only work part time? there’s no way i could ever go back into debt again and eat ramen every day…ugh…that sounds like a nightmare!” 

then when that friend does it anyways, the naysayer changes their tune a bit because it seems “crazy” that anyone could go through with something like that if they can’t. “did you hear john is going back to school? yeah…i dunno…a lot of mid life crisis these days, eh? he could barely keep up with his life before so how is school gonna work? welp…let’s just sit back and enjoy the sh*t show i guess! lol!”",0.10413152017509349

3077,"hi! i started my undergrad at 31 and finished at 35. i started my masters at 40 and am finishing up now at 43 (going part time because i work full time.) i'm also not yet married and don't have kids - which was somewhat by choice. 

don't feel old or stupid. ""should"" is an awful word - take it out of your vocabulary when talking about your life because it's referring to that society or your family or whoever else decided is the right path in life. but there is no right path - that is different for everyone. 

also - i would get discouraging comments about how old i'll be when i graduate and whatnot - but here's the thing. the years are going to pass regardless. initially i was going to do my undergrad part time, and people were like 'you'll be 40 by the time you finish, why bother?' here's why: the years will pass regardless. i was going to get to 40 either way, so i'd rather get there with a degree. (which i did!) you're going to graduate before you're even 30 - which leaves plenty of time for career and marriage and babies. i know it sucks being older than everyone but so what? honestly, most classmates admired me for doing it regardless of my age - and i was often closer in age to my teachers than my classmates!! (i was older than one teacher and a month apart in age from another - but i remained excited to be there.) i even studied abroad when i was 34. the collective group of study abroad students at the university in quito was about 40 students, and i was over a decade older than all of them! so group activities for the abroad group weren't usually my speed, but ai did make friends there. i also ventured out on my own a lot and found friends my own age. 

the point is - it's your life and you don't have to follow a generic timeline that you think is what people 'should' do. also - you can't go back and change things or start school earlier or whatever. your circumstances brought you to where you are now, and it is what it is. so the question you ask yourself is do you want a college degree? because if you do - then get it and don't worry about being 4 or 5 years older than the other students. honestly, being only 25 - your classmates prob don't even know you're several years older (unless you tell them.) not that you should be secretive about it, but it's also none of their business. be proud of yourself for getting your degree especially having to do it a little older, and if age comes up, consider that you may be inspiring to them. in grad school i made friends with a classmate who is 7 years younger than me, and he felt old and a little discouraged for being in grad school in his 30s- but he saw that i was excited to be doing it in my 40s and it inspired him, and he admired me for it. there were 5 of us from one class that formed a little group and we are all still friends to this day - our ages are 27, 28, 30, 36, and me at 43 - and these are some of the best people i know and i love this group! 

you can be discouraged and drag yourself through, or you can accept that this is where you're at and enjoy it and be proud of what you're accomplishing period. who cares about age?

next, i'd really analyze if school is for you. a lot of people go into school just because that's what you do, but for a lot of people it's just not for them. take a year and try a bunch of new stuff. many recommend trade school, which can be good for some, bad for others. you might be able to get an apprenticeship, which can give you a ton of opportunities. if you decide on the military path, go airforce, and get a technical job. these jobs pay the best and translate the best to civilian work. you can also just get an entry level job. sales is the highest paying, but plenty of other roles can provide fulfilling work. it's just about finding what you enjoy.

there is no scientific or medical evidence that abortion is dangerous or should be illegal. period. you're just not going to find such a thing. i used to sometimes see it argued, when i went to catholic school in the 90s, that there was a correlation between abortion and reproductive cancers, infertility, etc. but i think even that is not evidence based according to modern medicine. just a speculation from decades ago that was never proven.

505,"voice major here. i’m lucky to have a great voice professor, but i’ve heard a lot of horror stories, even in my own school. ultimately, you know yourself and your voice best, so i’m not going to tell you what you should do, but here are some perspectives to consider:

1.) if she is not getting anywhere with you, especially after three years in, it’s probably easier for her to blame it on you instead of accepting that her teaching style isn’t working on you and she will likely need to modify her approach with you to see results. some people just need that, and there’s nothing wrong with it. if she’s not willing to tailor your lessons to you, then it might be time to find someone else to teach you - a new professor at the same school, or take a risk and transfer schools!

2.) if you are putting the hours in and practicing as you should be (i.e. not goofing off and playing the piano in the practice room (we all do it 😜)), then the only thing you can do is your best. but, make note of what habits you are actually building into yourself and how you’re practicing. you’re obviously not happy with where you’re at, and neither is your teacher, so maybe try switching some things up in your practice. for starters, please don’t practice more than 2 hours a day maximum. your voice will get tired out, swollen, and you won’t be as productive. i like to do an hour to an hour-and-fifteen at a time. no longer than that. prioritize, do the stuff, then get out of the practice room. rest your voice, take care of yourself, etc. chronically swollen vocal folds from over-practicing can really stunt your growth and progress since your voice is in “survival mode”.

3.) i had a professor one who said some really nasty things to me, and i found out later that it was an attempt to motivate me to be better. try an audition, do something to show her that you’re willing to put in the work. she might be eagerly waiting for you to rise to the challenge and prove her wrong!

4.) the real world is full of people like this - she may just be preparing you for it. i do believe that at the collegiate level, it’s better to be honest with students than to try to sugarcoat everything. she just may be trying to give you a accurate perception of yourself and where you’re at right now. that being said, though, having a growth mindset (instead of a fixed mindset) is the biggest asset you can have in this field. if she’s right and everything she’s saying is true and you know it deep down, the best thing you can do for yourself is to just accept it and move on. it’ll be painful; it’ll make you want to quit. but once you accept the reality of the situation, you’ve officially started the journey to improvement.

5.) on the other hand…if the things she’s saying are blatant lies and you know it, do something about it. report it to someone, record your lessons so you have proof, make a push to switch teachers, whatever you need to do. you won’t be able to grow in an environment that is holding you back. you’re paying for the degree, so get your money’s worth by working with someone who actually wants you to learn.

6.) there could be some miscommunication happening. having a conversation with her if you feel you need it never hurts :)

the reality is that fundie/mormon/high-control religious groups tend to hate secular universities (and school in general) because you'll be taught things that go against creationist beliefs, you'll be taught to question authority and think for yourself, and you'll be around lots of ""ungodly"" people. they are probably under the impression that going to a secular school will be what makes you turn your back on religion, especially if they don't know you don't believe anymore. 

i know someone who went through something similar, and eventually, his parents came around and accepted that he was an atheist. in the end, they just wanted to see him thrive. i've also seen it go the other way with the more high-control groups such as mormonism or jehovah's witnesses, but if your parents aren't in that camp, then i'm sure they'll come around with time. the best way to prove to them that you've made the best decision is to work hard and show them that you're happy and successful. their concerns are because they love you and want the best for you, so prove to them that you know what's best for you.",0.06900655593423542

personally, i think the main problem here is that your perception of fun is having sex, getting drunk, and dating girls.

as some other commenters have said, you can still have fun and be social without jeopardizing your academics. join clubs. apply for student government. get a job on-campus. get an internship.

point is, i've done none of those things so far and i've still managed to have an amazing experience. i joined a leadership group where i actively volunteered around campus. i became president of the history club and got accepted into phi alpha theta, the national history honor society. i got an on-campus job as a peer advisor and recently got an additional on-campus job as an orientation leader for the summer.

if your school uses the css, it’s a guess. assume that a little is fine, a lot would impact it. 

either way, we are talking about your junior year financial aid when it comes to income (your sophomore year looks at 2022 taxes). of course, if you have $10k sitting in a savings account from working this summer when you fill out the fafsa in october, that could impact your 2025-2026 financial aid. assets matter, too. ",0.0674199862463242

also where i go to school there is a huge push for getting students to be good at managing time, setting goals, and being productive with their day. this gives the appearance of business school being easy as a lot of us business students, due to this push, are more likely to be better at time management than our academic counterparts so we can usually go hangout and easier to have a social life. also huge push for networking and getting to know people in the business school and i had a class where i had to report on my networking activities every week. this sounds great as many will say you get credit for being social but at the same time when i have a busy week i have to be on top of it so that i can make time to have networking opportunities throughout the week. unlike my engineering friends who when they had a busy week could just focus on their schoolwork. this networking assignment tbh isn’t a big deal but it is something to bring up.

1) you can act now and push. no matter what you do there always is the human element: you have to do interviews; you have to report to someone; you have to work with others for a common objective; everything in life involves working and interacting with other people. i would say as someone who is kind of an introvert but being in the teacher and counselor roles, you have to pretty much keep your own personal feelings within yourself and you have to go out there and pretty much expose yourself. jobs are all about being resilient and being adaptable to different situations which are strong markers for a successful candidate in any field. if you do have social anxiety issues, i do recommend may be starting slow like joining a club that you enjoy and getting to know members. you never know what opportunities you will have if you do not do it to begin with.

dating 1.5m . i'm 19 f and 19 m. i really like my boyfriend however i can feel awkward and worry alot as i can get a horrible stomach ache which leaves me with acid reflux and feeling drained for no reason. it's either anxiety, sign we aren't for eachother or something else like danger. i need advice. i'd like to continue seeing him and seeing if it goes away and i love him or if it gets worst and i feel so sick constantly. i don't want to lead him in to ive told him many times about this. this is my first relationship. i'm just looking for comfort and ease in relationship however i can feel so sick i might throw up. he's a super lovely guy and we click in many things however i think my brain obsessed over bad things like at dinner we get tired and drained and so he goes in his phone for a bit. i thought like shit that rude and i worried and spiraled into this isn't normal. we should have so much to talk about. another thing is he is more spontaneous than me and better looking. he cheeky and makes sex noises in public and wants to chat up random people in street. i find this very embarrassing and don't like it. i tell him in jokey way but don't want to change him but i'll obsess over this as i'll think we aren't compatible. i'm too boring and he's too immature. he's had a long term relationship before too so he has more experience than he.i feel drained with his sometimes after couple hours or days straight together and i worry that's not normal as his my partner. also i see men of s similar age and i'll think like oh he is cute and i worry like shit that's bad if me to think that. i wouldn't want to have relationship or anything but find them cute. is this bad sign? 
he makes me feel good tho and when we hold hands or kiss i feel this lovely, buzzing holden energy.
however i'll then think that's just because i've never done this before and i worry i'll never fall in love with him as i overthink everything and don't get attached to people much. 
also what do you do in relationship. what's good deep questions to ask.
can i get advice on what to do? how should i deal with my doubts and obsessing over differences? i think i have stomach ulcers too. i get scared incase down the line i don't like him but i'm trapped and that feels horrible.

honestly, i'm just confused.

so, i get plagiarism—stealing others' ideas, not giving credits, etc. but, in the case of a group project where each person *also* ends up writing their *own* paper... does discussing things count as plagiarizing because it's related to each others' ideas?

basically, i'm in a group of three people and we're doing a chemistry experiment together, and then we're each going to write our own individual papers. my question is, would discussing the results of our experiment and discussing potential ideas for the discussion section be plagiarism? and i don't mean like ""hey, look, this is what i wrote for the discussion!""—i mean, like, just talking about it; like discussing potential conclusions or limitations to our experiment, for example.

you mention you bounced around retail jobs - did you work on any political campaigns? municipal, national, or anything in between? did you sign up for any kind of mentorship program that matched you with someone willing to teach you how to get into the professional field?

it sounds like you were thinking that getting an education somehow leads to a job, but it doesn't. no matter what field you go into, you can use school to learn material, concepts, skills, etc, but you still have to put legwork into finding your career path. yes, some college programs guide students through that process (programs with co-ops, etc), but political science is far more broad and you can go in a number of different directions.

you may consider registering just so the accommodations are there in case you need them. extra time might come in handy some day, after all, and the process of getting approved takes too long for you to just start the process if and when it turns out you do want the accommodations. any disability info is separate from your academic record; it's private unless you request accommodations (and even then, we professors are only told what your accommodations are, not your diagnosis).

913,"hey, i just finished writing my honors ba thesis in chemistry. i had a really hard time with it too, to the point that the first time i got feedback on it was 4 days before my defense, and that’s when they told me i had to rewrite everything. 

i know it feels hopeless, but try this method. build the presentation first, then fill in your essay to match it. 

and most importantly, remember your thesis is your journey through research, not the story of the research you were a part of. you are describing all of the things you directly did for your thesis and how they individually advanced your hypothesis. 

do you feel that you were on too many projects to pick one clear thesis? that’s fine, pick a larger topic and break it down into about 3 goals. the thesis itself is pretty flexible in terms of format, so you can craft it however you want, as long as it follows the overall guidelines. 

i know these examples may not apply to you exactly, but my dms are open if you want more specific advice.

most importantly, remember your mental health is vastly more important than any research you could do. take breaks, spread out the writing, and dont be too hard on yourself. it sounds like your advisor is awful for making you feel bad, but really, any lack of thesis material their fault for misguiding you. obviously you cant point that out to people though. if you are closer with other members of your thesis committee, you can also ask their advice before the defense. 

finally, remember, this isnt grades, its pass/fail. converting that to letter grades means even a c passes. your only goal is to finish the essay and tell the story of all of the things you've done. literally make a list if all the projects youve worked on and pick one figure/chart/picture from google that you can use to show your contribution. then go through and see if those pictures tell the whole story. if not, add more to each slide. if you run out if content, then go to your advisor.",0.05407380704358751

first of all it’s group work, which is bad sign number one.

secondly the way it’s graded is horrible, groups consist of three people. so, we dispersed our work three ways and the final guy is supposed to finish it and do his part whenever he can. however, due to all of us taking multiple courses we just do our part then leave it to the next guy. but in the rubric it says must be more then 800 words and 1.5 pages…. now, since we aren’t baby sitters we cannot constantly monitor how the last person did and we only have one submission chance. so usually the last person submits it for the group. 

now here’s where the fucked up part happened… the professor doesn’t grade shit until 3-4 weeks out… which is a problem… considering we have a report every week with once chance. so there’s quite literally no room at all for trial and error, if you fuck up the first one then you’re fucked until the professor gives enough of a fuck to grade it; so you can realize your mistakes. 

we even did an entire report that involved us 3d printing an object for our topology optimization project and got a 0 on the entire report, because last guy didn’t make it 1.5 pages it was 1.3…(oh fucking brother)

how well do you handle stress and managing your time to deliver things on a deadline? 

can you see yourself managing other people? or you'd prefer to be a kind of specialist? 

are you a detail-oriented person, or do you enjoy bigger picture planning and strategy? 

would you prefer a job that entails a fair amount of routine work, and doing the same kinds of tasks over and over, or would you prefer to have varying projects/ tasks and perhaps take a different sort of job in your field every few years?",0.05050762722761053
1121,"hello! i am currently finishing up my sophomore year in college and have recently decided to explore some minors. i have completed all but 3 classes for my major, 1 of those being capstone, which i plan to take fall of my senior year. i have been exploring the idea of a sociology minor for the past few months and have researched it and felt that it will be a good addition to my psychology major since it revolves around the study of people and behavior in society. i was also going to do a second minor in social psychology because it would only take a few classes but decided against it due to it falling under the sociology category and that felt redundant when i could gain knowledge in something else that could benefit me. i recently learned about the public health minor and became interested in that as i am interested in the clinical field of psychology, specifically geropsychology (the psychology of aging). i switched out one of the sociology electives i planned to take next semester and replaced it with introduction to public health to see if it is something i would be interested in. if i don't end up liking it, it won't really delay me from graduating because i still have 2-3 empty slots to fill up anyway to meet my credit requirements. i was wondering if anyone has any personal experience or more in-depth knowledge of this combination of fields. i know they all can complement each other, i just wanted a more insightful and knowledgeable viewpoint.

3480,"i think your financial aid covers it if you fail, but if you withdraw you have to pay the tuition back for that class. however, that’s a question for your specific college, because i think the rules may differ from place-to-place. 

aside from that, there’s nothing wrong or unusual about failing/withdrawing/retaking classes. people do it all the time. you’d be hard-pressed to find someone who *didn’t* fail/retake a class in college. 

also, i’m kind of in the same boat. i’m doing very well in my other two classes, but i’ve got a c in my precalculus class with two exams between me and the end of the semester. i’m putting everything i’ve got into precalc. but goddamn, it’s objectively one of the hardest classes my college offers, because it covers so much material in just 16 weeks, most of which we’re expected to memorize as none of the exams are open note, and only a handful of formulas are provided to us for exams. 

most of my class is struggling, if not outright failing. and the prof is not the greatest at teaching the material (she can do the math, but her explanations are not always great, and all of her exams, so far, have had pretty significant errors in them). i don’t know how my c is gonna weather the next couple of weeks, but i’m gonna work my ass off to soak in as much information as possible, and hopefully i pull it off. 

in short, you’re not alone. you’re not a failure. and you’ll be okay in the end. college is not life-or-death. if you fail a class, find out why you failed and then retake it with the knowledge you did gain from your first go with it. and you’ll do just fine!",0.04879500364742666
3348,"so, there are a few things that could be going on here. first, a lot of people come into college without any real study skills (yes, studying is a skill you can learn).  many schools will have a page or two somewhere on there website with resources for this. a bunch pop up if you just google “studying strategies.”

another common issue is coming underprepared for class. you mentioned not understanding what’s happening in the classroom. if there are assigned readings, are you doing those beforehand? do you ever look up anything outside of class to see if an alternate presentation of the material makes more sense to you?

if homework is an issue for you, do you start assignments early enough that you have time to ask questions before the due date? do plan enough time into your schedule that you can complete assignments without rushing through them?

i also find that many students do not reach out until it’s too late in the semester to raise their grade/really engage with the material. do you ask questions during class or attend office hours? have you emailed any professors or tas with questions? are there tutoring sessions you can attend? could you form a study group?

college can be a big adjustment and many students do not take to it easily, but don’t let this stop you if it’s something you want to pursue (and can afford right now). this is only your first semester, so you have a lot of time to turn it around. consider taking a reduced course load next semester if it doesn’t affect your financials.  and definitely take some time to reflect before the next semester on where you can improve your engagement/efficiency in your studies.",0.04879500364742666

so first off, i know there are a lot of people that have taken these many credits but i haven’t and have found even the 16 credits i take overwhelming sometimes. i hoped i could keep it under. however summer classes would cost me like $4k out of pocket if i don’t take unsub loans. i really don’t want to take those loans but i’m wondering if i should

i am trying as much as possible to graduate in 8 semesters because that’s when my scholarship runs out and i won’t be able to afford school. the reason i don’t want to take on unsub loans is because they accumulate interest immediately.

any advice please? should i bite the bullet and take the 18 credits or take on the loans believing i’ll pay it back when i graduate?

3430,"hi everyone - i need some advice. i feel like i’ve made some gigantic mistakes in my career and education, and i’m trying to figure out if i can still turn things around.

for reference, i’m 28. i have a bachelor of fine arts in theatre. i know, i know. 

i grew up extremely poor. but not in the “poor so you grew up being aware you have to make money” way, more in the “so poor no one in your family has any financial literacy so you should really do whatever you want because you’ll probably just be poor anyway” way. i was an empathetic child who loved storytelling and decided on a fine arts degree because i had no real understanding of career outcomes. 

now, i’m an adult with several years of work experience under my belt and an entirely different set of values, but i’m feeling very trapped. 

i was a top performer in high school. 5’s on nearly all my ap exams, including up to calculus bc. every teacher i had pretty much begged me to not go into theatre, but i was a kid and had made up my mind. i went to a private university on a full scholarship because of my grades. even though i studied theatre, i was still part of my school’s independent honors college, completed a thesis, and graduated summa cum laude. 

but now, all i have is a bachelor of fine arts degree and regret. 

i want to change my trajectory and go back to school for something i should have studied in the first place but i am finding it incredibly difficult to navigate. once you obtain one bachelors, so many supports drop away. admissions processes seem to be very unclear for second bachelors, and i have no idea how i would pay for a program without financial aid.

i know many people say to skip the second bachelors and go for a masters, but i am looking to study within a stem field and many stem masters (especially computer engineering - a top interest for me) would disqualify a bfa without blinking an eye. 

are there any resources out there that could help guide me through this process? i appreciate any help or advice. ",0.04642383454426296
2496,"lots of community colleges will have programs specifically aimed at those looking to transfer to a 4 year university later. have a look into that for wherever you're taking de classes.

another great way to look at this is to find a bachelor's degree you're interested in at a 4 year university you're interested in, find the course requirements online, then find credits at the cc that would transfer for their core/gen ed classes. both the uni and cc should have tools online showing credit equivalency.

a major is your main course of study. a minor is an add-on, usually a lot fewer classes, but isn't as significant as a major. kinda like pepperoni on your cheese pizza.

an associates degree is usually 60 credits worth of work, but a specific 60 credits. if you're transferring to a bachelor's program later, you don't have to finish the associates degree first.

prerequisites are merely classes you have to take before other classes. what a lot of people refer to as ""prereqs"" are better referred to as ""general education"" classes, ""geneds,"" or ""core classes."" think math, english, humanities, etc.

while talking, we talked about relationships and i found out that he was bi and i told him that i was gay. however, i told him that i'm in a relationship. he was happy for me and congratulated me. after meeting up with him, i got his snap and started a streak. ever since then, i talked to him about meeting up again, he agreed. the only issue i'd that he doesn't put in effort for making plans since he claims that he ""is really bad at making plans."" i did not really care since i usually make plans with friends regardless. within the last few weeks, i've brought up hanging out and getting food or something, but he seems to be busy. 
likewise with making plans, i usually engage the conversations on snap. we both are majoring in different things, so we never cross paths on campus. with that said, talking to him in person has not been achieved. while texting, he always gives me short responses. 
overall im debating if i should just drop making plans with him and keep him as a streak buddy, or if i should keep on trying. my theory is that he knew i was gay, cause it is kind of obvious, but lost interest in me after i told him i was dating someone. while he is always busy, he did mention to me that he has some work problems with management and has to work 50 hours a week along with school.

1004,"first, you’ll need to pick a major that best suits your interests. you can major in anything, but keep in mind that you’ll need to complete prerequisites, like biology, chemistry, etc. it may be easier to major in something that aligns with this, like health sciences or biochemistry. 

once you pick that, you’ll need the following. 

- good grades. you’ll want at least a 3.5 to be competitive for most programs. 

- patient care experience. work as a cna, emt, home health aid, etc. get experience being around patients. 

- shadowing. you need to shadow doctors to make sure this career is really for you first. you’ll also need shadowing hours to apply. 

- extracurriculars. join an intramural sports team, the microbiology club, a disability awareness group, your pre-med chapter at your college, etc. get involved on campus. 

- volunteering. get out in your community. look for local ram clinics, volunteer within schools, etc. this looks great on applications. 

- research. you’ll want to look into research opportunities on campus. this may not be necessary, but it’s a huge advantage if you can do some undergrad research with a microbio or anatomy professor. 

- mcat scores. you’ll study for several months for the mcat. a 500 is considered the minimum to apply - people have gotten in with lower, but 500 is sort of the unspoken magic number.

2961,"i'm in a group project with 5 other people. one of them (who i'll call cindy) has used chatgpt and barely changed anything that it output for our past 4 paper submissions and subsequent presentations. we have been trying to get her to actually do reasonable work for the duration of the project, but she seems to be completely unable to understand our requests.

we have an evaluation form where we grade our project members after each presentation, and the percentage they each get determines their grade. ex. we get a 90 on the project but my overall effort score from my project mates is a 50, i would get a 45% grade. my project mates are reluctant to give cindy a bad grade due to pressure from some of her friends and worries that she will retaliate by giving everyone else bad grades.

i'm sick of all this, and recently realized i could probably make a good case for an academic integrity violation. we're in a few chatrooms and there is a little evidence of her using ai in her work which i may be able to pack into a personal report on her unethical behavior (not to mention the poor work quality), but i'm very worried that this will trickle down to everyone else who's actually doing work. we did, after all, submit multiple papers with barely-edited ai slop in them as a group. every member of the group except for me used chatgpt in some capacity, for ideas or for outlines of our papers, but nobody has done anything on the level of trash that cindy has, and i don't believe any of those things are academic integrity violations.

also, some ai detectors i tried to use online were dubious at best, reporting my own original work as ""potentially ai"", but reporting the paper as a whole as ""not ai"", and i technically cannot prove that cindy's section is ai in its current state except for how it's formatted very different from the rest of the paper with a kind of question-and-answer format that does not fit what we are trying to do.

does anyone have any ideas on what exactly i should do in this situation?

1111,"i will give some background context to this. i started university at the age of 18 but a personal situation happened where i got kicked out of the university and i losed all motivation to return to college. i was going to be a student athlete at the time. then, upon returning to college in the spring at a community college i had more problems dealing with mental health. 

as a teenager in high school i dealt with a lot of bad people which made my mental health worse. fast forward, in 2019 it is affecting my college days by me completely flunking out in cc. mind you, i still have that first university’s debt to think about while attending school and during high school i had serious trouble attending class due to bullies. 

then, more down the road i attended a local community college instead of one to be a student athlete. and, things seemed to be better, i started getting credits towards an aa degree, not c’s either— all as. i never really had a problem attending class except one semester where the workload seemed impossible for me so i had to withdraw. as semesters gone by, and me getting used to the community college environment, i did really well while attending there. took me three years to get the aa degree, and got a’s in all my classes, except math, passed with a c. 

what i am trying to get at though compared to the normal undergraduate college student i would be over age (23m). while most students graduate on time at the age of 22 with a bachelors. i feel so down because of this and feel like a failure almost every day. i notice students start master’s programs later in life not right after their bachelors. so that alone is keeping me from feeling really really bad about myself. 😕

i'm a fifth-year senior at a major state university and i've noticed substantial changes in the faculty following the pandemic in my department. it's beginning to take a large emotional toll on me and i've been considering the value of education following this realization. 

i've had numerous professors within the last 2-3 years arrive to classes late, add additional coursework to an already established syllabus, cancel numerous classes that often result in 1-2 weeks of no class time, professors who cancel class for personal or professional trips, or display a general lack of respect for students. these things feel as if they come at the expense of my education. literally and figuratively. 

i must note: student behavior has changed, too. and in ways i don't feel i must make explicit-- we're all students who directly face the strenuous college lifestyle. perhaps this is attributing to these changes?

besides covid-19 and the lack of student engagement, i cannot find a solid ""answer"" to these cultural shifts on campus. additionally, i'm struggling to recognize if this is an isolated change at my college. i understand professors are people, too. i'm not attempting to shame nor interrogate professors. instead, i'm curious in how and/or why these cultural shifts surrounding college etiquette and expectations have changed.

right now, i’m a public affairs major and i’m thinking of double majoring with psych. reason i chose this was because with public affairs, i feel like a career working for government/public policy gives you the opportunity to really make a difference from the root of problems (like you help change the structure of society, if that makes sense) and help a wide amount of people in a way i feel like other majors aren’t necessarily. i also found my comparative government class interesting in high school, and i would like to work in food policy or healthcare policy. psych because i am extremely interested in social norms and psych is interesting anyway. wanted to double major because with public affairs i didn’t feel that my interests were being fulfilled all the way.

i’m currently a public affairs major. got in it because it seems like a major that will truly help you make a difference and i found my gov classes interesting in high school. but somehow my hs classes were more interesting than my college ones now.

other majors i’m considering: “health promotion, nutrition and exercise science”, “philosophy, politics, and economics”, public health, psych/sociology

688,"i am a teacher, so i may be able to give you some insight.

i want to start by saying that it sounds like you got hit with a lot in a very short period of time, and that is always very difficult. anxiety and depression often follow major life changes like the ones you described, so i am not terribly surprised that you are experiencing those feelings right now. the hardest part is, when you start to lose, you lose momentum - and then things get worse - and then we start making prophecies of our own failure and inadvertently fulfill them.

with all that being said, take stock of where you are, not where you fear you are. 

***with the first professor, hand in the missing assignments with as high a quality as you can***. even if you do not pass, it will be worth salvaging your grade to the best of your ability. as a teacher, i can tell you that i am far more likely to pass a student if they make the effort in the end than if they give up entirely.

***with the professor who is not responding to email, i would suggest figuring out what their office hours are and showing up in person.*** don't mention the emails unless they ask something to the effect of ""why haven't you contacted me?"" your main goal is to convey that you want to make the most of your remaining time in their class and learn as much as you can - that you are sorry that you missed as much content as you did. if they asked why you weren't there, give them the short version and take ownership of what you could have done - but don't beat yourself up. even if they don't pass you, use this as a learning opportunity and make the most of the time you have left there.

both of these things are difficult, but necessary. it will set you on the right foot for next semester - rather than getting into the cycle of running away - which is common for students who are in a tough spot. i was one of those students too.

i know your pain when it comes to finding yourself without your friend group, and changing to a campus where few, if any people know you. i also experienced problems with my major and my friend groups too. all of that sucks. i didn't have an abusive relationship, but my long time girlfriend dumped me just before i got into my last semester of my senior year. it sent me into a tailspin of depression. this was all a long time ago for me - but i haven't forgotten.

227,"i heard that even in professional settings, that “high school” feeling never truly goes away. 

i might get downvoted for this haha. but i’m actually in support of talking to them. 

the word “confronting” is usually associated with negative feelings that could make it seem like you’re risking everything. if you look at it with the perspective of “they’re my friends, i should just tell them how i feel” it feels less doomy and could make it a bit more comfortable to open up to them. word choice is really key. 

for example, instead of saying “you guys make me feel left out” you could say “i have been feeling left out” or “i feel like i’m missing out”. when we begin with “you” or the other person, it makes them feel like you’re attacking them causing an unproductive dialogue. instead, tell them how you feel. because in the end, we really don’t know what the other person thinks or has to say and starting off with “you” makes it seem accusatory, and we really only know how we feel. when they say “why do you feel left out” you can always answer with “i notice that i’m not understanding inside jokes or that i’m not participating in events that have been planned, and i just want to know why.” then you can explain your perspective and they can explain theirs. it’s about understanding, not so much about who is right or wrong because nothing is ever black and white. i’ve learned this the hard way. 

discussing how you feel doesn’t have to be confrontational. and besides, when you open up just a little in this way, you will absolutely know if they are your friends or not. one thing i learned in therapy is that your feelings are not facts. so to save your mental health and unnecessary conflict, it’s always best to just talk it out and ask because believer it or not, most of the time we are overreacting. lastly, if things don’t turn out well, you can always be proud that you advocated for yourself and your boundaries. it’s a win in my book.

why am i being downvoted ? i was the one who was harrassed here, what did i say that was wrong ? like i've said this is an anonymous account so if anyone wants to judge me for that fine that's not my problem however there's simply a reason why that's anonymous plus i'm not doing anything immoral or illegal, in real life being in school i simply socialize, going to the gym, study and it's called a community online for a reason",0.03934447376823168
3603,"for this whole semester, i've been stressed about grades. all the people in my school care so much about them. i'm doing a biology degree and do research so all everyone talks about is doing good in school. i cried when i got a 75 on my physics exam because i felt i was letting everyone down. i studied hard for, what felt like nothing. today, i got a 69 on my o-chem 2 exam and i don't care. i studied hard for it, gave it my all, and it's okay. i learned that a rad-tech program i want to go into only cares about the grades of select classes. those are the only grades that matter and i haven't taken those classes yet. since learning this, the feeling of anxiety i get is gone. the worries of my gpa are gone. i've been doing nothing but stress, lose sleep, gain weight, and i think my hairs falling out. but now i feel as if i can enjoy getting my education, because it feels like nothing matters. sure, when the time comes to take those important classes i can deal with the anxiety then, but with finals coming, i just don't give a shit anymore. not when i see those numbers, i think i need to improve. i stopped thinking of them as scary things to avoid. i would probably feel the same way if was lower. in the end, i was putting so much weight on these things when now they don't matter. if things don't work out in the end, then i'll figure something else out. instead of stressing out over giving your all to something and getting nothing in return, seeing what 100% can get you and not getting what you want in return, and feeling the soul crushing shame of failure, we should learn to go with the flow and understand that the anxiety of school isn't worth it and you can be fulfilled with whatever you do in the future. don't feel like a failure if you gave 100% to something and get nothing. as long as you're trying you're learning and that shame you feel from failing can only be treated from the humbling experience of you coming to terms with you being your worst enemy. i hope this helps someone and i hope that anyone can offer any other ideas. i am open to having my mind changed and my words challenged ",0.038014296063485276
520,"hello, for context, i'm 19m at my freshmen year at the university of wyoming, and i have asperger's syndrome-or high functioning autism for short. at our university, we are required to live on the campus dorms for our first year, and in these dorms, they're all shared, so, typically, there's two people generally sharing a room. 

our dorms are built from the sixties, so despite their aesthetic appeal (i love that type of architecture) it makes for a very unattractive living situation, so you can easily hear your neighbours conversation, the elevators are slow and sometimes don't work, and the building seems like it's falling into disrepair. despite this, i generally like my universety, and i'm grateful that my dad worked too pay for my first semester and half of this one (i cover the other half myself.) 

this past semester, i really struggled and failed. i was suicidal for a couple of weeks in october, but during this period i wouldn't really do anything. i would hardly leave the room, and i felt so guilty. even talking about it makes me fairly depressed. however, as a result, i thought that i was a shitty roommate because i hardly left, so this lead me to ""oversee"" many of my roommates behaviour because i thought i would be hypocritical. 

in the past month, i've gotten my act together. i'm going to class, studying, and putting in the work along with trying to balance my part-time job at our dining centre on campus. i want to be a successful student, and i want to learn. it's been years since i've felt this way. i finally don't feel depressed and hopeless. 

well, at least i was... 

a month ago, my roommate started snoring severely during the night. this went on for several nights before i told him that it was happening. he told me his dad has sleep apena (so does mine), so i suggested he gets it checked out. it got so bad i could close the door, and hear him a door or two over still in the hallway. i told him it would help if he could sleep on his front or side, but this wasn't an issue (i didn't make it one rather) because it's not his fault, and i was just trying to let him know that was happening. 

more recently, however, things have gotten worse. as i've tried to pull myself out of this academic hole, it's became more apperant to me how awful and inconsiderate he is as a roommate. for the past four nights, he's kept me up (bare minimum) until 1am. on average, it's nearly 2am until he stops playing video games. now, i don't really have an issue with that-it's his life and consequences at the end of the day; however, when that starts to affect me, it's an issue. as he plays his games, he is always taking to his friends. he laughs, screams, and in general makes noises that keep me up. sometimes, he's woken me up because of this. when i've already fallen asleep. i could be asleep for two hours, and he'll just wake me up. last week, i asked him, politely, if he had any issues with me. he said no. he said i was an ""good"" roommate. additionally, i told him if he has any problems with me, too just let me know about them. he also said that, he tries to be considerate towards me, but i find that statement silly. 

i've been trying to let him know about his behaviour: i told him about this last week, i've slammed the door on him whenever he shows up now, i stay out of the room way more, and i've blocked his ass from all my social media. i only have his phone number until i don't have to live with him anymore. 


he doesn't ever clean up the room, go to classes, never doesn't not cheat on his assigments (dude is a fucking education major), and he talks like he's in the seventh grade. i'm not joking. my grades are starting to slip because of him keeping me up. i missed my fucking classes yesterday, and i've been feeling like shit recently. i miss ya dad ;(

469,"music school is kinda notorious for abusive and toxic advisor/private lesson relationships. see the movie whiplash for some cathartic stuff. it allowed me some room to be a little more critical of my toxic music school advisor after seeing that movie.

i had a similar experience when i did my undergrad in music performance. the guy i was taking lessons from and advising me had all sorts of lofty ideas for what i would be doing with a music performance degree, but was hilariously out of touch with the current trends in the industry. he was still pushing orchestra auditions and cruise ship gigs as if either were good options that could pay bills or provide a reasonable quality of life, assuming that i even won an audition. which is hilariously competitive, i.e. 100-200 people audition for an single spot, many of which are in there 30s with phds and a decade of daily practice.  
  
if i could redo it, i would change advisors to someone who wasn't so abusive and toxic. there are probably a half a dozen other voice teachers in your school, i would recommend seeing if you can change over to them. you don't deserve to be gaslit and belittled by this voice teacher. 

crying is not normal, but i will be honest that i had similar experiences, and all of the other students in my studio had similar experiences with our professor. none of us deserved his abuse, and it was absolutely not worth the suffering. i could have got a degree piece of paper from pretty much anyone and it would have been worth the same.

your vocal coach sounds like they are withholding praise to get you to work harder and spend more time trying to get better at performing. which... ok... but the reality of the music industry is pretty toxic even if you are an amazing vocalist.

\_\_\_

  
not sure if this helps but here is a timeline of how i ended up spending 4 years of my life in a toxic relationship in music school, still working on recovering via talk therapy now over 10 years later.

freshman year: i placed in all the top ensembles and got a constant stream of compliments and approval from most of my ensemble directors and main advisor.

sophomore year: i placed into even better ensembles but my advisor was starting to get super abusive and nitpicky and a real downer. 

junior year: some grad students showed up in my studio and were indeed better musicians than me, taking the top ensemble spots. advisor became increasingly abusive and i became depressed. realistically i was probably depressed before this...

senior year: advisor handed me off to the grad students for individual lessons, i was pretty mad about it, but they were way less abusive than he was. i stopped participating in the jazz bands as it wasn't required for graduating. i did the bare minimum in all my classes, graduated and moved back in with my parents.

\_\_\_

post graduation, i floundered around and got fired from six jobs within a year, all front line customer service jobs, restaurants, hospitality, call centers, etc. eventually managed to leverage family network into an entry level it job at a public school. lots of talk therapy and group therapy, and improving my it career skills later, i am pretty happy and content and have a lot of things figured out.

you don't deserve to be in an abusive relationship with someone who absolutely does not hold the keys to your future. the music industry is so fucked, that even if you were the best voice student in your program and your vocal teacher was great and you liked them, you still wouldn't end up with a job that pays the bills after doing grad school. well, you might, but i know so many amazing musicians who are destitute, or hustle super hard with all sorts of side jobs to make ends meet. 

if you really want to make it as a vocalist, you need to be in la, nashville, or nyc. thats it, there are no other options. well, i suppose other countries have their equivalents. if you aren't willing to be a starving artist hustling in those extremely expensive places, its probably time to start thinking about what you are going to do with your career, whatever it ends up being. if you can end up with that undergrad degree, change lesson teachers to someone not abusive, and then figure out your early 20s path to a career, it should work out in the end. if your parents are rich though, the rules change, you can probably spend the next 10 years practicing and living in one of the above cities and eventually make it work.

you got this op, and you absolutely don't deserve to be verbally abused.",0.028771766882421796
3007,"hi! aspiring nurse here too. i am applying to my community college's nursing program, adn (associates in nursing) program for fall 2025 and unfortunately i have to do it in the 4 year part time format because of my current work schedule and how much i work and the mandatory overtime for a good part of the year. i will be doing my bsn in an accelerated format once i am done with my adn and am an rn i will look for an employer that will pay for my bsn as long as i work there for x amount of time. my job covers tuition so i will be able to get my adn done with little to no cost to me. 

i already have an associates in criminal justice and i almost graduated with my associates in marketing this fall until i realized how this is not my passion and i can pursue nursing. i had no support system, sure i had a support system but only if i chose something *other* than nursing program. pretty fucked up. but now i just turned 30 and i'm on my own now, so i can follow my dreams not do what other people are pressuring me to do. my community college requires 3 pre requisites - elementary algebra i, essentials of chemistry (b minimum in both) and biology of the human organism (c minimum) and the hesi-a2 entrance exam with 3 subject areas, math + science + english. 70% on all main subject areas and 70% cumulative score is required. i plan on going above and beyond those ""minimums"". 75% or more of applicants who meet those minimums are accepted into the program. i am taking a prep course for the entrance exam to ensure i'm really ready. also studying months in advance for it.

i would say that the hard part, especially in california, can be getting into the program. i'm in upstate ny. some places require more pre requisites and/or a higher grade in all pre requisites than my program requires. what's on the entrance exam is different for each school. some do teas and some do hesi-a2. my community college's nursing program itself will require me to keep a c minimum in all my courses. the first 2 years i do ""basic"" courses, before entering the core nursing classes, but half i have done with my criminal justice degree and i will only have a&amp;p i and ii, microbiology and math for health sciences to do. so even though i am doing the 4 year part time evening classes program i will have a specialized schedule and plan to complete the program it may turn into a 3 year part time program rather than 4. i have to keep a c in a&amp;p i, a&amp;p ii, microbiology and math for health sciences before i can continue onto the core nursing classes. 3rd year, all classes in both semesters need to be c's before moving into the next year. 

yes nursing program will be a challenge, but it's not impossible. my ex's mom went back in her 40s to do it and she was very successful. i just turned 30 as i said above and i'm glad i have done other things degree wise to prep me for how to do school. do not let the difficulty level discourage you from doing it. you could do what i am doing, adn then once you're an rn find an employer who will pay for your bsn as long as you work there for x amount of time, or do bsn immediately after your adn especially if places in your area hire nurses with their bsn more than nurses with their adn. i may do it that way if i cannot find an employer who hires the way i want to, the whole pay for it if i work there for x amount of time. it can be done online 100% i believe because you don't need clinicals or anything for it since you're already an rn.",0.027317918235407652
703,"i'm 21, i've been studying computer science and going to graduate end of this year. but i'm not your average comp sci student, i got into it due to my passion of creating products, but uni hasn't been liked this, focusing on theoretical coding/math which i'm extremely bad at (ive always been like this). i've barely passed most of my courses through memorization, asking many questions, and spending lots of time through brute force. i haven't truely learnt or understood much. i don't know, i've just always been like this since school, i can put lots of time into things i'm passionate about, but not efficiently or with good coding standards.

as such, i'm not confident in my abilities so i'm not looking forward to getting my first job (i've been on the doll). i will have like 30k in hecs, and 25k in the bank by graduation, which i'm at a crossroads of putting into hisa or etfs but that isn't the point of this post.

i also have had been amazed by stuff like chatgpt, i've kept up with all of the research and developments. it's been a light in the tunnel, but also a dark one, for someone like me who isn't smart. dark in the sense that if i take a gap year, i'm almost sure ill come back to systems which are nearing the point of making me obsolete in the work force. it might not be there yet but its semantics at that point, it'll happen in the next year or two if it isn't.

however, it is also amazing because it can then help me to create all the ideas i have, and i could be some baby enterpreneur. i would love if it worked out like this and i could finance it.

and i havent really gotten to travel. i've been told if i travel after graduating it'll be harder for me to find a job afterwards. this is concerning because i'm already not confident in finding a job. and my friends and family will keep asking me what i'm doing and i just hate that, i just want to be left alone. and i genuinely think i'll only get to work a couple of years before ai makes me pointless in the workforce. it sounds nice for me to travel for x months and come back to a different reality where i can see where my skills may be needed elsewhere. as for my travelling, i'm not sure where i'd go yet, but i'd love to backpack solo and travel on the cheapest of shoestrings. by working while i'm overseas (even though i've never worked before) and couch surfing, or pet sitting, or sleeping in a hamac, id hopefully limit costs so that i won't be taking $ out of the bank. also not sure how long i could go for but the more the merrier i say? i'll practice it in australia before before going overseas.

and most importantly, expectations of my future and my wants/needs:

i do not care to have a family, i do not care for a house, i'd much rather a hotel next to public transit in a walkable city. i don't have a car and i don't plan on getting one (i have my license but i just hate driving so i don't). i really hate the rat race of society which is likely why ive not worked a day in my life or done too well at uni. how i've been treated while on the doll has reaffirmed this, and mental health has declined just from this idea of how people treat you differently. it's actually made me want to work **less** because i'm really stubborn and if someone annoys or patronizes me i **hate** taking their advice. i would rather sacrifice my livelihood by living as cheaply as possible while still feeling secure by having access to necessities ie food/power/sleep then to constantly focus on money. for what? just so i can afford to eat out, shop and buy junk or go on some extravagent travel? i'd rather cook something myself (even if i dont have many of the skills atm), only buy necessities that i really really need, or go on cheap travels and experience the country in a less touristy manner. as such, i do not really care if i get 200k, 100k or 50k as my annual income, i already don't spend money as is (thats how ive got 20k in the bank without working. i do live with my parents though.). all i really want and value is time, so i can focus on other parts of my life.

also, i have like 0 life skills but im willing to learn if i'm not patronized constantly, which is the main reason i haven't up until now. that's a big reason why i want to travel and work overseas or live with others.

what do you think?

2237,"hi, i am just writing this because right now i am not sure what to do. i (f) am an english and creative writing major at a pretty large university. i am a freshman and this past semester i took a workshop on intermidete fiction. from the beginning i was the youngest person in the class made up of mostly juniors and seniors. i should also let you know that there are only about nine people in the class. as far as i am aware i am the only person in the class who has gone to the professors office hours and asked for extra help. everything three weeks i am asked to submit 20 pages of short fiction for the professor and the class to critique. this past week i was extensively proud of my work. i spent hours and hours writing and rewriting my work and submitted it four days before it was due. during class however, my professor (m) is supposed to give the class 25-30 minutes to critique my piece. without giving too many details (they would likely bore you) my professor saved my work until the last minute and barley said anything. the class, despite being energetic to critique everyone else's work, clearly had not read my piece. my professor told me that my main character was not fleshed out and had no information, i was confused because the first two pages of my piece are details of the main characters life, appearance, background, and thoughts. he also mentioned twice that he liked that my piece took place in 1942 (in the middle of ww2) when the piece states multiple times that it takes place in 1939 just before the war began to truly affect america. the one other student in my class who gave me feedback and seemed to have read my piece, told me it was strong and compared it to the boy who we critiqued before mine saying that i had similar dialogue but needed more physical details. my professor however, compared my piece to a girls who went two weeks before me who wrote a fanfiction about an anime that was so confusing to read the whole class asked her to rewrite. obviosuly i wasn't going to be an asshole and say mine was better but i sent this piece to my highschool english teacher and my grandfather who both said it was one of my best. after only ten minutes of crtitque where my professor basically told me to rewrite the entire thing, a student brought up taylor swift  and the professor quickly said ""i don't want to interrupt you girls discussing taylor swift"" and left the room. i was on the verge of tears. this has been a problem all semester of my professor not taking my work seriously and not reading it, despite reading every other males work. the feedback he left on my piece was two lines of the twenty pages that he underlined and said simply ""good historical context"" which feels very minimal for a professor who just asked me to rewrite the entire piece. long story short, it is clear that he did not read my piece, assumed it would be bad and half-assed my edits. my male counterparts piece had line edits on every paragraph and a detailed paragraph written on the end of his paper explaining what he did well and how he can improve. my professor has been rude all semester and once even took my phone out of my hand in class when i used it to check the time (my male counterpart next to me texts constantly and the professor never comments let alone takes his phone out of his hands.) i am not sure how to address this professor or confront him for not reading my work. i know i could just ignore this but i took this class because i genuinely want to be a writer and want feedback that can help me improve. i am sorry this is so long i did not intend it to be. any and all advice would be extremely appreciated thank you so much.",0.023596458909150433
3765,"i’m in my forties and i went (back) to college late, and i’m fine. hell, i’m having the time of my life. i did the party thing when i was in my twenties, never got married, never had kids. i get treated like an elder statesman, where students come to me with questions because i’ve got my shit together and i made the mistakes they don’t want to make. 

a weird thing happens when you get older: you kind of just want to help people. i don’t know if it’s some kind of parental thing that comes up as a matter of age or if it’s just an understanding that the world doesn’t revolve around yourself, but i just want students to be as excited about the material as i am. i tutor a lot of students, and i draw the line at the ones who just want a grade and don’t care about the material. i’ll tutor compsci students who are struggling with dsa all day long, but only if they really want to “get it” on a fundamental level, and i’m not even in compsci anymore; i found another calling. but, i still tutor them because i really enjoy dsa, and i want them to enjoy it, too.

i’ve got a job offer on the table from my current employer. i’ve got one on the table from a former compsci classmate, in case i ever decide to go back to pushing pixels. hiring managers don’t really judge age (because over 35, they legally can’t) because employment is largely transitory today. the days of working for a company for 40 years are gone. today, if you work for a company for ten years, you’ve outlasted most of your bosses. they care if you can do the job.

that said, it’s not a meritocracy. whom you know is more important than what you know. where i work, we are gaming out the scenario where we get a big contract, and that’s going to mean rapid expansion, and every conversation includes the words, “does anybody know someone who can do that?” the devil you know is better than the devil you don’t, and it’s often better to take someone who is 90 percent as good as the best candidate because you know the 90-percenter’s flaws, but you don’t know the 100-percenter’s. and then there’s the sunk cost of going through a hundred or more applications, vetting, hiring, training. why do that when you can hire someone who will hit the ground running?

when i did my last go-round at community college, before ambling off to university, the students who were my age or older had one thing in common: they were hungry; knew what it was to be beaten down and get back up again. one of my lab partners needs a job for the summer, because my program requires major-related work hours in order to take capstone, and i told him i’d ask my boss about an internship, but i put the biggest fucking caveat on that recommendation you’ve ever seen. he’s not hungry; he’s desperate, and those are two very different things. he’s unrepentant (except to professors) about using chatgpt to write papers, which suggests he wants to do the bare minimum; has zero work history; he’s an average intellect on a good day. i don’t want him as an intern. so i picked the freshman who said, “hey, i have to get 400 work hours by senior year,” because that kid is planning ahead. he’s … maybe not hungry, but knows he doesn’t want to be hungry, and that’s just as good.

you’re right about older students being confident in their decisions. there’s an absolute truth in steve jobs’s stanford speech, where he says (hang on, let me grab the quote):

&gt; when i was 17, i read a quote that went something like: “if you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” it made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, i have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “if today were the last day of my life, would i want to do what i am about to do today?” and whenever the answer has been “no” for too many days in a row, i know i need to change something.

he’s right. if i had finished out my compsci degree, i would have eventually thrown my chair through the window and escaped like chief at the end of cuckoo’s nest (spoiler alert for a movie that’s before my time, let alone yours). that’s why i tell students, “don’t declare until you’ve taken the intro class. if you enjoy it *and* you’re good at it, that’s your major. if you fail at one of those conditions, take electives and gen eds. find something else. you don’t want to be in your thirties and dreading every day of work. it doesn’t get better; doesn’t get easier.”

so, if you have older students in your classes, ask them questions. they’ve had life throw things at them, and they’re usually happy to tell you how to recognize an incoming curveball or to duck when a fastball is coming for your head. they recognize the signs of impending doom, and a lot of recruiters would rather have somebody who’s been around the block than someone who’s never left the house. there’s a lot of soft skills they tell you to learn in preparation for the workplace, but experience, in life or in a professional field, is something you don’t get until after you needed it.",0.022599230735278433
