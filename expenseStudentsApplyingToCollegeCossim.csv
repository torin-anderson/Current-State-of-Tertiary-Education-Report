this past month i have been extremely lucky and grateful to have been accepted as a questbridge college prep scholar and as a leda finalist (not actually accepted yet, still need to schedule interview). the downside, however, is that i just learned i can only do one, as cps and leda are very similar programs. as a very clueless student, i have no clue which to pick, and some advice would be greatly appreciated. here's some pros and cons off the top of my head:

leda  
pros:

* all expenses paid summer camp at princeton or yale (very very exciting)
* does... something? stuff?

cons:

* haven't done interview yet =&gt; might not get in
* extremely unclear what exactly the program accomplishes
* cannot do qb

pros:

* already accepted
* 6x more likely to get into national college match
* college admissions conference at rice
* does something i think

cons:

* also very unclear what the program does
* admissions conference is short, not paid for (gas and hotel is very expensive), and is not particularly exciting

im oos for all of my options

order of price highest to lowest:
- penn state
- texas a&amp;m
- ohio state
- umich flint ( but after two years it would be the ann arbor price so wayyy more expensive after)

i haven’t done too much research on the schools so i need a little but of context maybe from others experiences about what choice is the best option. (im gonna visit all of them throughout this and next week)

ohio state

pros:
- great ranking for engineering
- great social scene and school spirit
- football games would be really fun from what i’ve heard
- their scholars program seems really nice
- like the logo

cons:
- have to apply to my top choice major which is mechanical engineering so i’d be competing with other students for a spot my first year

penn state:

pros:
- entrance into engineering major isn’t as bad as the other options (3.0 gpa or higher)
- well ranked engineering program
- great student/social scene and school spirit
- beautiful campus from the pictures ive seen

cons:
- expensive
- haven’t done too much research on the school

texas &amp;m

pros:
- amazing school spirit
- top 10-20 engineering program depending where you look online
- weather would be a lot warmer than my other options
- love their maroon color

cons:
- would have to compete with others for a spot in my too choice of engineering major or maintain a 3.75 gpa for guaranteed entry
- not too sure about living in texas due to its political climate, especially because tamu is especially known for being pretty conservative, but again most colleges are all the way on the other end and tamu could very well just be more moderate than anything

umich flint to ann arbor:

pros:
- if i maintain a 3.0 gpa or higher i’d be able to transfer to ann arbor after two years

cons:
- i’d have to live in flint michigan for two years
- umich flint itself is really low ranked so if i don’t maintain a 3.0 i’d be stuck in flint or i’d have to transfer somewhere else
- flint price is not the worst but ann arbor price is really expensive so after two years i’d have to almost double my payments

pros:
-weather. beautiful weather all year around. 
-the campus is literally on the beach
-vibrate social life and everyone was super cool when i visited. 
-i’m going to econ and accounting and ucsb is a target school for the big4
-the qol seems really good there. everyone i saw seemed very happy.

cons:
-outside of school expenses, the cost of living in sb is crazy high. 
-the administration doesn’t seem super well put together. there were several mistakes on their end when processing my admissions app/housing app and whenever i called in with questions i always got different answers and it was confusing.
-all they have for housing atm is double rooms and i’m not super excited about that. this one is more nitpicky and not a huge deal. 
-they have a weeder course to get into econ and it’s notorious for the amount of people who fail out and have to change their major. i’m a little nervous about that. 

umich econ lsa

pros:

-big college football culture. i love watching sports so this is a big plus for me. 
-they gave me in state tuition because of being a veteran
-ann arbor seems like a really cool place to live
-the admin that i’ve worked with have been a dream. super responsive, helpful, and knowledgeable. 
-more internship/job opportunities 
-more things to do in general

cons:

for background, my family is upper middle class, and we make a lot. my parents actually agreed to pay the majority of my undergrad, even at the out-of-state school. i just constantly feel guilty about my decision. they've tried to reassure me and tell me the financial aspect isn't huge to them and stuff, but i guess it's also that i just made a huge decision and i don't know what's happening and i'm going like 8 hours away to an expensive college and what if i hate it and i don't know i want to cry, it won't get out of my head. i'm filled with anxiety and i feel like i just made a huge, stupid decision.

the main thing holding me back from committing to the t5 is that i'll be paying an obscene (especially when converted to my currency) amount of money. to give you context, the tuition for the t5 school would be 10 times the tuition of the one in my country and this school is already considered  expensive in comparison to other local colleges (i would estimate that most colleges in my nation would be half the price of the top one). i was fortunate enough to obtain a selective merit scholarship that covers the total cost of my entire stay to this school. the school would even give me an annual allowance and would also cover other miscellaneous costs like paying for my dorm or off-campus housing (they'll even let me choose) if i decide to attend. 

if i attend the t5, on the other hand, my parents will be fully paying since i'll be receiving no aid. i already talked about this with them and they are willing to pay the full price if i truly want to study there (although they are hesitant about the safety and just the general living experience in the us and the fact that i'll be extremely far away from home so i've been getting the vibe that they want me to take the full ride for convenience and proximity). i feel like i'll grow the most and find the most fulfillment if i study in the us. the opportunities i'll have access to there will also be extremely valuable in the career i want to pursue. however, i am aware that the job market is tough right now especially for international students and i'm concerned that i won't be able to land a job after college and that my degree would be nothing more than an expensive piece of paper that is really just a liability. 

so is it worth it to pursue university in the us despite the circumstances or should i stick to the comfort and convenience that the full ride would give me?

one more random idea in my mind, i thought that since university is so expensive, what if i had to pay an outrageous amount of money each semester or asked my parents for assistance? what if i ended up failing overall, regretted my degree, or just didn't like it? in that case, my money would be lost, and i would probably end up in debt.

2677,"for many students, the college admissions and decisions process is the first time that you really get to make a major decision about your life. when we’re kids, typically our parents make the big decisions for us, and our decisions are smaller — which friends to make, how much to study, which extracurriculars.

it’s absolutely normal to have some regret or anxiety any time you make a big decision in life — which medical specialty? do you want to have kids? should you move your family in order to pursue a career promotion?

any time we say yes to something, we’re also saying no to other options. that’s true for anything, even down to deciding what you each for lunch. but choosing a college is probably the first time you’ve had to make a really big decision that can affect the future course of your life. having some doubts or wondering about your choices is normal. welcome to being an adult!

it might help to write down your reasons for your original decision and your doubts. write down pro and con lists for both schools, if you haven’t already done that. probably you would have felt a bit of regret no matter which decision you would have made. that’s normal. 

i think you’re very self-aware. you have clear reasons why you chose the more expensive school, and you think it will be a better fit and set you up for your career. only you can know your parents, but unless you have a good reason not to, trust them when they say they can afford the school you chose. this reddit is full of people advising not to take on debt for college, but it sounds like you wouldn’t have significant debt because your parents can pay. that’s a gift — it’s okay to accept it.

case western reserve pros:
- three hospitals around
- tons of opportunity for clinical hours and research

cwru cons : 
- the campus isn’t really centralized or enclosed 
- i don’t think people here have much fun 
- classes seem incredibly difficult


university of kentucky pros: 
- really cool honors college opportunities 
- bigger school, so more places to fit in
- more typical college experience 
- still has healthcare resources to draw from
- id be more competitive for opportunities than at cwru probably 
- less expensive by $20k 

uk cons: 
- less opportunities than cwru
- not right by cleveland clinic 


the money difference isn’t a giant because cwru would still be very doable as i got good scholarships from both, just more from uk so that’s a pro in its favor. its just weighing if cwru’s addition opportunities are worth it in terms of education and getting into med school.

2095,"i think the main reason to go to a more expensive university over a school like purdue/penn state/univ of fl/univ of de etc. for engineering is because you think there is a risk you may change your mind on engineering and want to have other options (besides business) to switch to.  also at any school with a strong engineering program, undergrads will be taught by tas. the quality of teaching by the tas could be better at a school like cornell. and finally, there's the networking factor. people want to make potentially life-long connections with students who will be future leaders and also maybe people who would be able to connect you with funding for a business venture in the future. it's not the teaching that makes the top schools so desirable - it's the potential to make connections with the top students that are there (at least it used to be - the schools that prioritize that seem to be changing).",0.08838834764831845

georgetown has rich prep school kids to dartmouth's fratboys, so that part's a wash. (actually, they both have rich prep school kids.)

georgetown's location in dc doesn't really confer any advantage over dartmouth when it comes to networking and professional opportunities, except in some very specific cases (working for a policy/security think tank/ngo or for the federal government, for example), but the dartmouth name will open doors for you in those fields too. dartmouth will serve you as well or better in careers like consulting, finance, etc.

i do get the feeling that harvard is great if you can get hooked in socially, somehow.  it seems very clubby, money talks, and if you don't have a particular interest, talent, or religious/ethnic group, something that gives you a way in, you can wind up socially isolated.  but really, it's like that anywhere else, too, but at harvard, the way into the social clubs is often by getting invited by upper classmen in those clubs whom you knew in your exclusive prep school,  who were themselves invited in by their older prep school classmates, whose older brothers and fathers and grandfathers and great grandfathers and so on were in those clubs.  you can find your group through clubs for your own religious or ethnic group, or via clubs for your own special interests.

the freshman dorm experience of living in the yard comes with community, but some of the rooms are tiny, and there are rats, mice, and roaches in some of the buildings.  the food is pretty bad.  the quality of housing in the houses for upperclassmen is better, but some of the dorms are sort of far from the main campus (the former radcliffe dorms), plus because students can and do apply for housing in relatively large groups, it promotes a cliquish environment.

as for academic competition - that's only if you're in a field that has quantifiable criteria, such as a stem field.  harvard is filled with students admitted via criteria other than standardized testing, who wind up majoring in ""soft"" fields, such as sociology or some form of ethnic studies.",0.07216878364870322

**ucla**

estimated coa  \~$40k/yr

pros

* in-state so my cheapest option
* close to home (1 hour-ish without traffic)
* i already know a good amount of students there, both from this year's class and previous classes
* i've heard the quality of life is better (good dining, people have a better sense of balance)
* big alumni network? it could just be because i already live in socal but i've always thought that ucla is probably the most ""well-known"" school of these 4 among the general public
* best overall in sports (not super important to me but going to some games might be fun)

cons

* hard to double major in cs and econ (doable, but probably a lot harder since there's no dedicated program for it)
* may be hard to change majors if i decide cs isn't right for me
* big state school, so maybe more sink-or-swim/cutthroat than somewhere like cornell?
* i've heard it can be really lonely/isolating
* you need a car to get around places (even the football stadium is an hour away)
* i want to get out of socal after having lived here for 8 years
* socal weather (can be nice but i prefer somewhere with 4 seasons since i grew up in boise)

**cornell**

estimated coa \~$83k/yr (haven't gotten aid report back yet but it's likely gonna be $0)

pros

* it's an ivy, so it's possibly more prestigious particularly if i want to pursue a field where that matters (finance, maybe even government or law)
* according to my friends the qol is very high and people are more fun/social
* it's ranked higher for cs than ucla
* double majoring and exploring different majors is probably easier
* strong alumni network, most people i know who went to cornell are *very* proud of that fact
* i'd probably like the weather/environment more than socal (call me crazy)

cons

* most expensive by far
* outside of ithaca there's nothing to do
* no strong sports teams that interest me
* seasonal depression (maybe? i'm fine with cold weather and snowy winters)

**georgia tech**

estimated coa \~$52k/yr (just going off website because aid report not back yet)

pros

* cs program seems to be top-notch and i always see this sub lauding it
* cost seems relatively low for an oos school
* threads program is really unique and seems more well-developed for any sort of cs specialization
* different atmosphere/environment in the atl

cons

* cost
* besides cs/engineering i'm not really sure if other programs are well-developed (especially econ), so it might be harder to explore other majors
* atlanta and the southeast in general can get really humid and muggy
   * this is why people in socal like to say ""we have heat but it's a dry heat""

**uiuc**

estimated coa \~$63k/yr

pros

* admitted for computer science and economics, which as a singular major would be much more manageable than double majoring
* top-ranked cs program that i see many swes come from
* probably the easiest school to explore cs plus other fields i'm interested in

cons

* cost
* kinda in the middle of nowhere

in terms of payment, my parents are willing to pay for tuition but i'd probably have to pay for other cost-of-living expenses myself, which is why i'm wondering if i should go to uc irvine, which i can commute to (not easily but it's doable) or uc santa barbara, where i got the regents scholarship.

atm i'm leaning towards ucla out of my 4 top options, so i guess my biggest questions here are:

* is any other school listed here worth paying extra for over ucla?
* is ucla worth paying extra for over santa barbara or irvine?
* as someone who got no aid, should i go to jc for 2 years to save money and then transfer out? or is there something in four-year universities that's worth paying extra/going into debt for?",0.07216878364870322

hey, would love some advice on where to go. super conflicted. applied cs, planning to minor in biology or econ, though i don't think that matters. for context, i am **not** following us news rankings since they are known to be biased. i am also out of state for both schools.

here's my list of pros and cons, ranked from what matters the **most** to what matters the **least** (prestige and job opportunities are most important for me, followed by cost. to be honest, location is nearly the same for both, or else that would usually be of importance to me). please correct me if anything is inaccurate on this list!

*umich*

* ranked top 5 or top 10 by most for cs
* cheaper for me
* company recruits are good (amazon, automotive companies b/c proximity to detroit)
* lots of different opportunities to pursue other interests (with minors, clubs, other t20 programs etc.)
* overall more fun, diverse (sports, art, dance, music, ann arbor is nice)
* somewhat farther away from me than cornell

*cornell*

* ranked top 15 or top 20 by most for cs
* ivy -league connections
* way more expensive for me, reaching nearly 100k in tuition
* middle of nowhere, harder to get recruited/find jobs
* less overall opportunities in terms of clubs, alternative programs, etc.
* school culture seems horrific (i.e. competitive nature, depressing place)
* ithaca is literally middle of nowhere
* sort of closer to me?

it may seem like i have a negative view on cornell overall, but honestly i'm still struggling to pick because of possible ivy connections. would love some insight from anyone though - parents, students from both schools, staff, whoever! thanks in advance.",0.06984302957695783

lower ranked

minimal to no party scene, have to look a lot harder for social events.

notes:

overall i think they're both great options for me. the gist of it is that i logically think that utd is the better choice because of the scholarship i have there and the fact that it's pretty good for pre-med students. emotionally though i feel like umn would be the better choice because of the ""traditional college experience"" which is something i was really hoping for in college. i think that i would be happier at minnesota but the logical and economical choice is dallas.

as for cost, i am very grateful that my parents are willing to pay for my education and they will support any final decision i make. that being said, they have made it clear that price is still a factor and as far as i can tell, they would rather i choose utd because of my scholarship.

rochester pros:

\- the take 5 program allows an extra year tuition-free to explore outside of major (really interested in this)

\- no gen-ed, allowing for exploration of courses

\- beautiful campus; loved the library

\- high-ranked engineering

\- i generally liked the vibe the most here when i toured, the students seemed intelligent and nice

\- emphasis on research (for better or for worse)

cons:

\- weather is pretty bad here (though it has tunnels)

\- more expensive than my other options

\- unsure about how fun the social life here is

\- farther from home

union pros:

\- major flexibility in engineering (double major, study abroad, etc) b/c it's a college, not a uni. 

\- well ranked engineering

\- pretty nice campus

\- amazing attainable research opportunities

union cons:

\- higher ratio of students in greek life and i've heard it dominates campus; not really the social life i'm after

\- extremely small (\~2,000 total)

my options are:

1. middlebury

* gave me a lot of financial aid. it’s still not a full ride, i still have to pay 12k but some of it is is covered by work-study pay and by this scholarship i have but it’s only 1k.
* i’m also worried about the location. i’ve heard it’s very isolated and im from a predominantly hispanic region of florida so i think i will get a huge culture shock given that there’s not a lot of diversity in midd apparently. i’m not used to a small town but i’m sure with time i’ll adjust.
* it is a really good university and i worry i will feel bad for turning it down but i’m conflicted on whether midd is the one for me. they sent me handwritten letters and this cute scarf thingy 🥲

1. honors program at a local cc

* a well known honors program at my community college where a lot of ppl have transferred to top universities like mit, yale, princeton etc after 2 years
* my dream has been yale since i started hs, but i don’t know if it’s worth going through another 2 years in the same process. my sat scores weren’t that good in the past and i know that i have plenty of time to work on that because of the fact that i have 2 years.
* i will save a lott of money bc everything is paid during my 2 years there. i plan to go to law school / higher education which i’m sure is substantially more expensive so if i can save money now it would be great.

1. waitlist spot at vanderbilt

* vanderbilt is one of my top choices and honestly if i get off the waitlist i will definitely commit bc i think the financial aid should be abt the same as midd if not more because of my financial situation.
* i still have to commit somewhere anyways since the decision will come after may 1st

any advice or tips on this are highly appreciated i really don’t know whether i should give mdc honors a chance but it would mean i’d have to go through the college application all over again. but a part of me wants to give other top uni’s chance again. but i don’t know if i’ll regret turning down middlebury. help!!!!!!!!!",0.06237828615518054

pros:
can work in the us 3 years after graduation
strong alumni network in the united states, potentially providing better job opportunities and connections for internships and full-time employment.
located in the united states, which may provide easier access to internships, networking events, and industry conferences

i'm an american high school senior (female asian/northeast) trying to decide which college to attend next year and i've narrowed my options to the uga/honors and mcgill desautels faculty of management. they are pretty different schools, but i have visited them and like them both. i would appreciate any input or advice!

i am looking to have a double major/concentration in finance (or another business major) and mathematics.  job placement and salary is important (although i'm not sure exactly what i want to do). work/social life balance is also important. 

uga overview: i was accepted to the franklin for a bs in mathematics and the honors college. i want to double major in finance/business major at terry and was told that it would be doable if i did well in business prerequisites.

uga pros:

* honors has benefits like priority registration, supportive community, funding for extras
* study abroad opportunities at oxford and other places
* more american company connections? 
* the professors seemed friendly, encouraging, and accessible
* college spirit, enjoy sports
* nice campus 
* 20k less than mcgill 

uga cons:

* getting into terry isn’t a sure thing
* internships may be hard to get according to what i was told
* could be harder socially- low diversity/ mostly in state/greek life not my thing
* small college town. i'm more of a city person. traveling from home is more complicated
* don’t love hot weather

mcgill overview: i would enroll in mcgill's desautels faculty of management and double major/concentration in finance (or another business major) and math. 

mcgill pros:

* internationally known name and program
* small faculty in a large school
* experiential learning embedded into the curriculum
* montreal is great
* i like colder weather (although maybe not this cold?)
* diverse international student body 

mcgill cons:

* is bcom a serious grind/competitive? does the curve impact grad school or jobs? 
* low support (people always say that mcgill does no ""hand-holding"")
* will my lack of french impact internship/work opportunities?
* i am american and wonder if this will impact internship/work opportunities

however if he plans on being a researcher or a professor he’s much better off doing it debt free, google pays its software engineers 250k a year but paying off debt on a professors or a research salary sounds like a waste of money. 

overall i think you can make it anywhere, as long as you try hard enough but the only reason your debating this decision is because your making the choice between graduating debt free or going to a prestigious school and missing out on that opportunity. keep in mind that college in itself is also expensive, from toiletries, food, spending money on friends, technology, etc. so if you think ur student can end up paying off the debt, i would do it. also!! there’s scholarships you can apply to even while ur in college.",0.05986843400892496

3614,"hi, so context. i'm from new york and have 5 days to chose a college. i've been fortunate enough to be accepted to northwestern, georgia tech, and nyu, which i'm extremely thankful for. also cornell offered me a 2025 transfer option that i might consider. i was originally leaning northwestern, but some people are telling me to take georgia tech or cornell since they're better for my major and after seeing the average cs placement and salary for northwestern it has me worried as even nyu seems to place better. could you help me out and tell me if i'm making the right choice going to northwestern for cs?

intended major: computer science or computer engineering, focus on security or ai



**northwestern university**

cost : full ride, so nothing

pros:

- research, i've heard northwestern is really good for getting involved in research which is something i intend to participate in.

- campus, i loved the lakefront, the design, and the town of evanston. i visited all 3 schools and liked this one the most. i also like the proximity to chicago and that it's not exactly in it either.

- student life, northwestern seems chill while also being rigorous. i image myself working hard, but also having a pretty fun time there.

- quarter system, i actually like this as it goes by faster and is more fast paced. it also will let me double major later on which i'm still deciding what i will double major in.

- ranking, i don't really care about rankings much, but i know it's a t-10 school and has a really good reputation overall.

cons:

- programs, i've heard the engineering and cs programs are weaker than those at gt. especially for security, that have very little. though ai has plenty of variety.

- placement, my biggest worry is that i've seen pretty poor placement, low average salary, and most people say the good tech companies don't recruit. this has be pretty worried for outcomes ig.



**georgia tech**

cost : 17k per year (oos student who received a pretty generous fasfa)

pros:

- programs, by far the best cs and engineering option i have. not only do they have more options and resources, their program is also renown. research seems plausible, but harder to find. that being said, the breadth and quality of courses here is better than northwestern. they have security and ai options.

- clubs, more cs clubs and opportunities. better networking and

- campus, i liked the campus a lot only a little less than northwestern. i find their campus very innovative and pretty nice overall.

cons:

- student life, i've heard many people are swamped with work and its less chill that northwestern. for student life i prefer northwestern a lot more and think i'll have more fun.

- price, the most expensive at 17k a year.

- double major, northwestern has more freedom outside of cs and i don't really know if i could even do a double major at gt.



**new york university**

cost : 7k per year

pros:

- closer to my family and friends, also in nyc which i might return to in the future

- placement? i've seen nyu has pretty solid placement and better than northwestern for some reason.

cons:

- programs, probably the worst out of the 3 here.

- cost, 7k a year makes it the 2nd most expensive option here.

- location, i don't want to commute from my house and don't particularly love the part of nyc that nyu is in.



also if it helps, i have a 2025 cornell transfer option which i might pursue, but generally speaking i prefer northwestern &gt; cornell for student life, but again the quality of the programs comes up. again, i'm extremely thankful for all of these options, just worried about outcomes i guess. sorry for the long thread, any help would be greatly appreciated!



tldr: help me decide northwestern full ride v gtech 17k/yr v nyu

northwestern: better student life, research, fit, and cost, decent program but poor placement.

gtech: better programs and placement, but meh student life and much higher cost.

nyu: close to friends and family, decent placement, but higher cost and average programs.

also have a cornell 2025 transfer pathway which idk.

**purdue university**

i dont care much about sports or school spirit.

purdue pros:

* very highly ranked in cs compared to binghamton
* my best friend is probably going here
* good career fairs

purdue cons:

* price - $39k after scholarship/aid
* large school, may be hard to feel like a personal experience
* location is just okay, not much around
* very far from home
* very little opportunity for dorming - i would like to have the opportunity to dorm for multiple years

summary:  
i visited both bing and umass and had good feelings about them.  
i chose not to visit purdue but i could still if i really wanted to; the distance and lack of dorming makes it unattractive to me.

which one should i pick? feel free to ask clarifying questions, i plan to respond to all comments.",0.05496497099293127

intended major: **biochem** (might switch to other bio related field)

intended career: genuinely don't know (maybe pharmacy or some type of lab work or medical field)

**university of california san diego!!**

ucsd pros:

* **highly ranked/funded research institution (good for stem major)**
* san diego is great biotech hub (not exactly biochem though and i don't plan on moving to san diego anytime close to after i graduate but could still be good for potential internships)
* beautiful campus + weather
* safe surrounding area with a lot to visit/see (beaches, restaurants, etc)

international student here. i got into all three in us 
and ubc&amp;university of toronto. ubc is a no since i didn’t get the international scholarship. my intended major is molecular biology/biochemistry/ biomedical engineering/biotechnology and then i wanna do masters/phd to work in biotech research. i got waitlested from colby, tufts, and emory. if i got off the waitlist for tufts i will be committing to there but as for now where do you think i should commit?

umiami:

*premier scholarship+$$$ (almost full ride)

*foote fellows honors program

*prism program (advanced program for integrated science and maths)

*foote fellow allows u to do a lot majors and minors and good courses and research interests in faculty for my major

*weather and miami

*cousin lives in boca raton (1 hour drive)

urichmond:

*richmond scholar (full ride)

*small school

*good programs and only college with leadership major

*not much professors with same research interest with me 

*close to major cities at east cost

unc chapel hill:

*didn’t get the scholarship but i will try to fond sponsor from my country

*one of the best public schools in the us

*good courses and programs for my major

*love duke&amp;unc joint opprtunities

*good study abroad programs

university of toronto:

*international scholar in both mississauga and scarborough campuses(180.000$ for for years + 15k first year for both and 12k more for four years in mississauga)

*still expensive tho with housing and food 

*one of the best for biotechnology and life sciences t20 in the world

*a lot of major biotech companies in toronto so good job and internship opportunities 

i also applied to uk and got into university of bristol, still waiting for edinburgh, and warwick. 

i probably wouldn’t go to colby over these schools but i love tufts and emory. in love with tufts majors and programs and emory is has good  programs as well. will wait for the waitlist results. until then i have to commit somewhere and i’m leaning towards umiami. what u guys think?",0.05407380704358752
3008,"so i plan to study more humanities like history or international relations. i’m currently in france and have the citizenship but am also a  us citizen. my top options are as follow:

- mcgill (faculty of arts) canadian oos tuition because of the quebec-france agreement, so like 8k euros per year without factoring in living costs. it’s in montreal, which is a city i really like, but it’s not in the us and i don’t know why but that kind of keeps gnawing at the back of my mind.

- gwu (elliott) got a 20k merit scholarship, so the tuition and rooming comes down to like 60k a year. it’s in dc, which i absolutely adore. i less adore the lack of a “real” campus (i find that having nice old traditional buildings is really enjoyable, the architecture of a campus does play a role in how much i enjoy it). i’m also a bit miffed by it being right next to georgetown (who rejected me), which i feel would be a constant reminder of my failure to get georgetown. i toured both gwu and mcgill and i had better vibes from mcgill as a school, but i think i slightly preferred dc as a city.

- emory. i got no financial aid and would be paying in full. honestly this is the choice that i think makes the least sense but somehow i can’t remove it from my brain. i like the look of the campus (haven’t visited it though), and atlanta seems to have a nice climate. it’s also in the us. another bonus is it seems to be highly ranked (correct me if i’m wrong), so i feel i’d be proud of saying i go there.

- middlebury. by far the most expensive option, 87k total per year. my high school counselor keeps telling me to go there, but i’m just not sure. it has a nice campus, but i want some access to a major city, and kind of don’t want to be lost in the middle of nowhere. i was told it’s great for international affairs, but i mostly have seen it praised for linguistics. i’m already bilingual, so i don’t think i would need that. beyond that it seems fairly well regarded. it’s also worth noting i got in as a feb, so i would have a different start to most people.

concerning money issues, my family can afford sending me to any institution i ultimately choose, but let’s just say that paying less for tuition would be preferred. my rational body is telling me mcgill; i like the campus and the city. but i keep having second thoughts. i guess i made a promise that i would return to the us for college when i left to live in france (i had previously lived 10 years in silicon valley, but was born near paris), and canada isn’t the us, although its anglo saxon and not too different culturally.

i guess i just would like any advice y’all could give me.

953,"i am deciding between university of washington, uc davis, and northeastern university. my intended major is biomedical engineering and i am having a hard time finding out which school is the best academically and where i will get the most opportunities from (grad school, jobs, experience, etc). 

any opinions help!! i have been so stressed not knowing where to go. 

i am planning no matter what to get a stem degree and go to higher education after (masters, p.a. school, med school, phd) 

uw-

pros: campus is perfect, in seattle (food+tech hub+lots to do), full college experience, lots of unique clubs, great greek system, ranked 25th for engineering, felt like students were very friendly and welcoming, lots of study abroad options

cons: extremely capacity constrained major (will be stressed out first 2 years cuz i’m engineering undeclared direct to college), highest acceptance rate (prestige kinda bothers me+may mean it’s less desirable to companies/ less quality academically idk), weather, heard area is really unsafe

uc davis-

pros: in-state tuition, know a lot of kids that loved it (connections+reassuring), very stem focused, ranked 28th overall, ~35% acceptance rate, nice weather, close-ish to sf, sacramento, and silicon valley, yummy food in area, bme major seemed to have cool new classes, actually in my major, safe, cool study abroad options 

cons: kinda in the middle of no where unless you take a 30+ min train ride, greek life looked eh, don’t know how hard it would be to get involved in research or internships in the area cuz berkeley is right there, felt like no one looked like me (isolating?), eh sports

northeastern:

pros: super low acceptance rate (would def feel good about myself), boston (activities, huge for biotech, lots to colleges in area), co-ops (not sure how clutch these are), medium size (maybe better advising + connections to professors), great ranking for engineering, probably good companies hiring

cons: as a california kid i don’t know a lot  about it, heard all they care about is $, admitted through nuin (abroad as a freshman, limits ability to go abroad later on in school), campus doesn’t feel 100% like a campus, not super well ranked overall (makes me nervous about quality of education+opportunities), hella expensive (parents would pay but may limit further educational opportunities), idk if i would fit in on the east coast, cold",0.051987524491003634

i was fortunate enough to receive admissions to the first three colleges (eagerly waiting on la) and was looking for some advice in the decision making process. note: la is not out yet and obviously i don’t know if i got in but it would be better to plan for it and then just void that part of the plan if i got denied than not plan for la at all. i don’t mean to come off as spoiled or pretentious in any way and i apologize if it comes off that way at any point during this post.

i am premed (pre-pa to be specific) transferring after 2 years at my local community college. i need about ~2,000 volunteer/working hours with direct patient care (already have about 200). i am looking to become emt certified, which most if not all of these campuses offer.

some background info about me: south asian male, parents are family oriented (plays into how far and where they would want me to go for school) but i want to be independent and live further to gain better personal skills.

current ranking goes:
1. cal/ucd
2. ucsd/ucla

cal: admitted to the cols, molecular cell biology with immunology track

- pros: intense courses to prep for pa school, connections with ucsf, 45 minutes from home, tons of research opportunities, the name can get my foot through certain doors, prestige to make my parents proud (and give them cute license plate frames :)), etc.

- cons: grade deflation, expensive housing, homelessness on and around campus, near oakland.

ucsd: biochemistry at 7th college

- pros: good biology program, 7th college is very nice and updated, good weather, better housing price and options.

- cons: far from home, no other family friends nearby.

ucd: global disease biology

- pros: already have a housing spot from one of my friends (4 guys in 2 rooms, 5 of us for fall quarter), lots of friends that i know very well (damn near my whole friend group), 1.5 hours away from home, student run clinics, hard but not as hard as cal and ucla, cozy town vibes, very nice gym and athletic opportunities.

- cons: heard it gets extremely hot and cold during seasons, too many people i know which could distract me, offered housing situation is not ideal, major is not the exact one i wanted but not that big of a deal.

ucla: molecular cell developmental biology

- pros: has a medical school, big city vibes, perfect amount of friends, good biology department, prestige.

- cons: housing is ridiculous, grade deflation, may not be as many premed opportunities (?).

i hope i made this bearable for all who decide to read, and i thank you all for taking the time out of your day to look into this.

1826,"you sound just like me. i could probably predict what your comments say too because i posted here saying the same thing. 

when i made my post i was angry. i watched people who i went to school with who were failing half of their classes, no extracurriculars, people who would skip school to party and never tried in their whole academic career receive scholarships, ipads, and macbooks to attend their top choice schools. i worked my ass off. i was so tired from studying that i would wake up on my textbooks. the worst part is i let my anger determine my self worth.

i was crying everyday wondering how i did everything right yet it all went wrong. i was waitlisted my top 2, my backup didn’t even put me in my major, and my others were either too expensive or too far from where i had imagined being. now, my only choice is to go to a local school and transfer. i was above the statistical average of the population that went to where i wanted, yet here i am.

i know that was a lot to unpack, but what i am trying to say is that you are allowed to feel hurt. you are allowed to cry and want more for yourself. people will always try to make you feel like it’s not big deal when it’s not their dreams on the line. i wish i could give you the cure to your problems but i came here to find my solution too. 
the best thing you can do for yourself right now is to breathe and look at what’s in front of you. right now it may suck but try to find opposites in your routine. if you stay in bed all day take a walk and breathe. if you’re always alone spend some time with friends. the moment you get out of the hopeless mindset you start to change your perspective to find solutions.

what i did was join an art summit that forced me to spend the next few days out of the house to appreciate nature and the value of art. i especially forced myself to do it alone to find clarity in solitude. the noise of thinking of everyone else is what kept me cooped up so i want to spend this time alone only thinking about me. 

i know you may not end up reading all i have to say, so remember this, right now put yourself first. you sound exhausted and you need to focus on putting yourself first in other ways than academics. everything takes time and maybe one day you’ll turn around and say “i’m so glad this worked out like this for me”. don’t look at your closed doors, look at your open ones and you will find yourself at peace with where you are. i love the saying “you can be as sweet as a peach, but not everyone likes peaches” because i know that i worked hard, but maybe the college admissions were looking for something more unique than me. and i’m okay with that. 

to conclude this, i want to say don’t let this break your spirit, you will need this drive in college and it will keep you above the rest. look at the future you want, and think of the the school as the vehicle that will take you there. make memories right now and remember that you are worth it to keep fighting for what you want. and look at the bright side, you could be walking down the path that was truly meant to find you. :)",0.04885319687460315
2522,"heyo reddit, i found myself in what feels like a predicament when it comes to deciding which schools to go to. so, i'm about to graduate from community college. usually this is supposed to take two years if you go full-time but some non-relevant circumstances prevented me from graduating in just two years, so it's taken me 3 years.

it's also important to mention that thanks to some legal agreements, my parents cover 4 consecutive years of college after high school, after which my mom will continue to help me out, though my dad will not. 

i'm about to graduate from community college, and i've applied to 3 transfer schools, two of which are in-state. initially i applied for the political science programs at all three universities about 6 months ago, but with some of the courses i've taken it made me realize i want to do something involving more data science and environmental related things, two things i have a stronger passion for. i know it seems weird to change my mind this late in the game, but i thought i was so far down the totem pole when it came to the classes i didn't have done, versus what would be required for programs in those fields.

anyway, so i'm really stuck between 2 of these universities as the 3rd one i don't really want to go to as i need a change of scenery and it's too close of a location with too much traffic. my first option is university of florida which is in-state. the tuition is cheap, i enjoyed the campus and it's a highly reputable school. however, i applied back in early october 2023 as a transfer for polisci, and nearly 7 months later, have still yet to hear anything. uf admits themselves that it is ""highly unlikely"" that you will be able to change your major after getting admitted. by comparison to say, ucf, they seem to overlook transfer students looking to go there.

my other university in mind is virginia tech. this is where my parents went, as well as some other family members. vt definitely seems more transfer friendly, has a beautiful campus and many programs to offer. even better, i recently got accepted as a polisci transfer (even though it's probably not a degree path i'd want to continue to go down). thankfully, vt seems more understanding and open about letting people switch their major, as they have much more info on that. the biggest downside is that since it is out-of-state, it is very expensive. i thought about getting a place off-campus for this year so by fall 2025, i'd be eligible for in-state so long as i had my t's crossed and i'd dotted for that to happen, but i'm not sure about that plan either.

if i decided to accept vt, i would have to let them know by june 1st. however the decision deadline for uf (as in the deadline for them to let me know if i'm in) is june 15th. so, it's likely by the time i have to give vt a response, i won't even know what uf says. i feel like neither choice here is that fantastic, and my mom even suggested i take a gap year, but i'm really not sure about it since then i don't have guaranteed coverage from both my parents, and i'd hate to put more of a financial burden \*exclusively\* on one parent. of course, i'd still do my best to get scholarships, pay the difference, etc. but i feel like i'm just between a rock and a hard place here. if anyone has any suggestions or ideas, it'd be greatly appreciated. thanks a bunch.",0.04522156316461346

generally i like umass' campus and size (and food) a lot more but am aware that rpi is much more prestigious and generally has better academics. also there's the factor of cost and transfer and internships and i've been really really torn over this for a while now and would really like some help and more information if possible such as over umass dual and internship ease from both schools and whatnot.

3410,"hello everyone!

i am a community college (political science) student located in the sacramento metro area. recently i've been accepted to every single school i've applied to transfer to (yay!) while this is great it's left kind of stressed about which school to pick. so far i've narrowed it down to two. uc davis and uc san diego.

**uc davis**

**pros:**

* close to home, so moving wouldn't be hard.
* close to my pet bird so i wouldn't feel too bad about potentially leaving without her.
* in-between both sacramento and the bay area which opens up a lot of potential career opportunities after graduating.
* campus looks really nice.
* walkable.
* supposedly good campus culture. from what i've heard it's very humble and relaxed.
* political science program is 30th in the nation and 6th in the state. so i'm most likely getting a solid education.
* decent bus/transit system from what i've heard.

**cons:**

* the weather. super cold winters and really hot summers.
* too familiar. having lived in the sac valley for most of my life i'm kind of hoping for something a bit different. from what i've seen, davis looks like the town i grew up in that just happens to be located near a great university.
* too rural? i don't quite know how to explain this one. it's kind of like the above con. basically, i've lived in an exurb for most of my life already, and i can't say that i'm super excited to be moving to another exurb/suburb/small city.
* unsure if i would fit in. for lack of a better term, i'm a hipster. i like alternative/artsy people and i'm not super sure if davis has that or if i would fit in.
* housing could be a challenge.

**uc san diego**

**pros:**

* far away. i'd really get a chance to establish my independence and start fresh in a new place.
* political science program is ranked 8th in the nation! i would be getting some of the best education in the country.
* weather is pretty good, plus the ocean is close by.
* campus looks great (i got into earl warren college btw if that's important).
* located in a major city so i get to be in both a super urban environment and have a lot of potential career opportunities.
* seemingly excellent public transportation system, at least, compared to sac.
* super diverse.

**cons:**

* risky. since it's super far away from home, i would be taking a huge risk packing up my life and moving it down there. i would also need to ensure that i have sustainable income and housing before even packing my first bag.
* expensive housing. since san diego is a popular city, and in california, housing is going to be a challenge. i'm cool with roommates but it would really need to be a perfect fit.
* competitive environment. i get stressed pretty frequently, and the rigorous academic curriculum ucsd is known for might not go over well for me.

these are all of the pros and cons i can think of for both schools. i've been debating this choice in my head ever since i heard back from both schools, and i haven't been able to make a decision. if this sub could help me make up my mind, i would greatly appreciate it. hopefully i've included any and all relevant information.",0.043355498476206

* beach is near
* student life is a lot of fun, but i don't plan on partying too much
* cheap, i get free tuition since my dad is a disabled war vet, but i would pay for everything else

* ranked #2 for undergraduate business
* working with haas graduate students could be a great opportunity
* #1 for venture capital funded startups 
* recreational sailing, always wanted to learn
* free tuition like ucla
* i read in a pamphlet that the program has a really good faculty ratio, like 4-5:1
* i also heard that they do case study competitions around the world
* shares study abroad opportunities with all uc’s
* new haas admits spend a weekend together in south lake tahoe
* in california, not far from home
* transfer credits, i have an aa so a few credits would transfer
   * could finish quicker and go to grad school for mba



cal cons:

* only one year of guaranteed housing
* i am not a fan of the bay area
* very political campus
* really competitive environment
* depressed students?
* grade deflation

intended course of study: wharton focusing on entrepreneurship

upenn pros:

* it has been my dream school for all of high school
* ranked #1 for business
* amazing study abroad/internship abroad programs
* prestige (obviously)
* philly cheesesteaks, one of my favorite foods
* east coast, i love to travel and would like to see what that side of the country is like
* the connections, networking would be really valuable
* beautiful campus and surrounding area
* just to reinforce, it is the number one, literally can’t do better
* i believe i could do better than average and come out with a good job or successful start up
   * i would be willing to do whatever it takes for it to be worth it

upenn cons:

* student debt
   * i would be paying full price, my parents can contribute some but i would still have a massive amount of debt
* east coast, far from home and expensive to fly to or from
* could also be competitive being an ivy, but haven’t heard much of that
* 2-year housing guarantee, but i feel like by then i will have found roommates to go off campus with

3217,"**intended major**: depends on school...however am considering **law school** 

* gtown - government (the college) 
* umich - ??? (lsa) 
* rutgers - accounting (business school)

**cost:** georgetown and umich are the same (gtown like slightly more). rutgers is significantly cheaper because of instate tuition, but i’m grateful to say cost isn’t the deciding factor of my decision!

**georgetown**

*gtown pros:*

* dc is good for internships/future jobs (also i like museums) 
* more personalized learning (smaller school) 
* teachers/classes + speakers seem most interesting 
* the name!!

*gtown cons:*

* campus/facilities (feels like they’re using the “traditional/old” appeal just so they won’t fix the campus…do they clean bathrooms often? how often do rats appear…is food good?) 
* rats (deserves its own category) 
* expensive area to live in 
* club exclusivity

**university of michigan**

*umich pros:*

* campus/facilities are really gorgeous!! (and clean from what i saw at least…and the food was nice!) 
* school spirit seems like fun 
* i liked the research opportunities &amp; help centers 
* the name (tho is gtown more reputable?)

*umich cons:*

* seems like academically-wise umich is only known for engineering or business (i’m in lsa…) 
* far from home 
* not in major city

**rutgers**

*rutgers pros* 

* facilities and campus are pretty good (better than gtown i think) 
* close to home (i can do laundry)

*rutgers cons* 

* after living in nj my entire life and saying i wouldn’t go here…it hurts the pride a little lol (i know rutgers is a good school, but then why did i try so hard in high school?)
* also i think i wouldn't be academically challenged 
* i dont want to do accounting (accounting the name of the school doesn't rlly matter)

**the dilemma:**

* **georgetown seems like it would interest me academically** and have good job opportunities. 
* **umich campus &amp; life outside academics is really nice** tho im not a big party person (and academics are good too! but maybe not for my academic interests?) 
* **rutgers is cheap**, and if i go to law school, i would like to save a bit for undergrad (though $ isn’t the deciding factor) and there’s grade inflation.

i don’t really know for sure what i want to do with my life. right now law seems like what i’m aiming for, but i don't know if that will be the case in a year let alone four more. if i go into law, would the opportunities (ex: internships, teacher recs) of a prestigious undergrad like gtown give me an advantage over rutgers? **does rutgers, gtown, or umich have the grade inflation i would need for a higher gpa?** 

additionally, if i don't want law school, i don't want to be stuck with a useless undergrad degree. (useless, meaning i cant find a job).

however, umich was also very impressive (i vibed). i’m not really sure what i would study in lsa, but i can see myself living on the campus. **if i went to umich i would consider transferring** **schools** or getting a dual degree with engineering. i've always loved humanities, but stem isn't the end of the world for me.

if you read this all, **you deserve every good thing in this world**. if anyone has any advice, i would appreciate it from the moon and back. help!!",0.03713906763541037
498,"okay, so basically i got accepted into both uoft rotman commerce and uga with an intended major at the terry college of business and waitlisted for g-tech (i find out if i got in after may 15th) but here's why it's so hard for me to decide:

**uoft**

* pros
   * near/in the t20 (my goal) 
   * the rotman commerce program is really good because it's in the business-y area of canada (as far as my research goes) and a lot of internship opportunities
   * i really like the location and campus and the woodsworth college
   * 50k dollar scholarship over 4 years (20k in freshman year then 10k per year)
* cons
   * it's more expensive than uga or g-tech (around 60-65k tuition)
   * further from home (and because i was recently diagnosed with arthritis, my mom gets worried really fast and easily)
   * cold weather - again, because of my arthritis being in the cold rlly doesn't help
   * academically challenging - obviously this is expected, but after these really really hard two last years of hs i'm just not sure if i'm ready to immediately jump into such a competitive environment
   * social life - although it's in the middle of toronto and has really good stuff socially, i've heard that the people in the program are really snarky and competitive and just not nice and i also want to be able to enjoy at least my freshman year of college socially because i really wasn't able to do that in my senior year of hs

**uga**

* pros
   * close to home so i can come home every weekend/every 2 weeks
   * i really like the campus
   * the terry college of business is really good and there are a lot of internship opportunities with it
   * the environment is a lot more chill so i can enjoy social life more
   * although i'm still considered an international student and don't get financial aid my freshman year, i'm pretty sure i'll be eligible for the hope and zell miller scholarships from my sophmore year - my senior year (cuts tuition by around 50% so from 40k as an international student to around 15-20k)
* cons
   * uoft is definitely ranked a lot higher than uga and therefore wouldn't look as good on my cv as uoft - although it's only undergrad, i do really really want to go to a top school 
   * uoft is my dad's top choice and although he would be really happy and proud of me wherever i go and he said his choice doesn't ultimately matter, i know that uoft would look better on my resume overall

ultimately, if i do get into georgia tech i'll definitely prefer going there over uoft simply because it's a lot closer to home and is still a really good school ranking wise (not that there's anything wrong with uga and i'm honestly really grateful to have gotten in and i love the social opportunities offered at uga) but i have to tell uoft my decision by may 1st and g-tech decisions come out after may 15th...

i also already submitted my deposit to uga to reserve my seat (this was before i found out i got into uoft i literally found out this week) but i'm just so unsure about everything right now

additionally, before i found out about uoft, if i wasn't going to get into g-tech my plan was to really make my resume impressive during my freshman year at uga so that i could apply to transfer somewhere else (probably apply to the ivies again) if i still really wanted to go to one of them so that's still an option.

i also do plan on getting a masters degree and going to grad school if that helps contexualising things

i'm honestly truly grateful for all the offers i got and the opportunities and the main issues between the two are about their academic reputation (lowkey bragging rights too) but ultimately i just want to be happy wherever i go. any insight or help would be really appreciated :))",0.03367175148507369
2128,"ucla had a 0.8% admit rate for their bsn nursing program for 2023.  i would not set my sights on ucla as a goal but there are plenty of schools where you can get a nursing degree.  

as a hs freshman, you want to meet your hs graduation requirements along with the uc/cal state a-g course requirements listed below.  since you are in a california hs, your hs curriculum should follow the uc/csu guidelines. 

[uc a-g course requirements](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/subject-requirement-a-g.html)

if you want a direct admit into a bsn program, then you need top grades and to exceed the minimum listed requirements especially in math/science courses. 

there are only 2 uc’s that offer a bsn program as a direct admit for freshman college students: ucla and uci.  as stated, ucla had a less than 1% admit rate and uci was a 1.2% admit rate. 

there are 3 cal states that offer a direct admit bsn program: san diego state, cal state fullerton and san marcos.  again, these are highly competitive and their acceptance rates are around 5% or less. 

many other cal states offer a pre-nursing program where you are admitted as a freshman, you take the nursing pre-requisite courses and then apply to the nursing school at the end of sophomore year.  as a pre-nursing student at any of these csu’s, there is no guarantee you will be admitted to that particular nursing school so you would need to apply to a wide range of schools at the end of sophomore year.  these are considered 2+2 schools. 

here is a link of the csu’s that offer the pre-nursing majors: https://www.calstate.edu/attend/degrees-certificates-credentials/pages/search-degrees-results.aspx?campuses=&amp;k=nursing%20pre-licensure&amp;

this is summary of how to become a nurse and the different options: 

the easiest and most direct way is to major in nursing as an undergrad the first time around. you'd need to go to a university that offers a bsn (bachelor's of science in nursing) program. these usually take four years, and sometimes take five. there are two flavors of these bsn programs. a small number of schools offer direct admission as a freshman (e.g., you're admitted to the school of nursing when you apply to the college, and you are guaranteed to be a nursing major as long as you keep your grades up). but most make you apply to the nursing school in your sophomore year to start your junior year. in those, you complete pre-nursing prerequisites in your first two years and then start nursing classes in your third year.

the second way is to complete a regular bachelor's degree (in anything, although a science major makes this easier), then go back to school and get an accelerated second bsn. absn programs usually take 14-18 months after your first bachelor's degree, which adds time and expense to getting your bsn. this route is usually chosen by people who didn't realize they wanted to be a nurse until after they were already in college, but i've known a couple of college students who chose to go this route because they wanted to go to a liberal arts college to undergrad and yet still wanted to be a nurse. if you do this you have to plan your prerequisites carefully, since colleges without nursing programs tend not to have classes like anatomy and physiology.

the third way is to complete a regular bachelor's degree (in anything, although again, a science major makes this easier) and then go into an entry-to-practice msn program. entry-to-practice programs are 3-year programs in which you get your rn in the first year and then your msn in the last two years, which allows you to practice as a nurse practitioner. this is only a good idea if you know you want to be a nurse practitioner (an np is a nurse who gives primary care).

really, if you know you want to be a nurse now, the best way is to go to a college/university that has a nursing undergrad major.

one additional option is to get an associates degree in nursing from a community college that has an approved rn program. those programs are usually competitive for entry, unlike most other community college programs. often, the community college has a waiting list for nursing and will make you take a number of science classes first to prove that you are capable of handling it, before you are accepted as a nursing major. your job opportunities will not be as wide as if you have a bsn, but you should still have no problem getting hired. many of those grads then go onto later get a bsn, while taking classes part-time. many health care employers will subsidize those classes.",0.024953256425297474
