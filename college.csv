0,t3_pbs6uh,1629952066.0,"**All questions about federal student aid, the FAFSA, and financial aid verification must be posted on this thread.**

If you want money for college, you should submit a [FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) if you are eligible to do so. [Click here](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements) to review eligibility requirements.

2021-2022 school year: Use the 2021-2022 FAFSA, which opened October 1, 2020. Requires 2019 tax information.

2022-2023 school year: 2022-2023 FAFSA will became available October 1, 2021. Requires 2020 tax information.

**First time? Here's a step-by-step guide.**

* Create an [FSA account](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch) (also known as the FSA ID). This is your legal electronic signature to sign the FAFSA. It's linked to your Social Security number. If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well, assuming they have an SSN. If your parent already has their own FSA account, they must use that. If your parent does not have an SSN, they must print and sign the signature page manually, then mail it in.

* Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.

* Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

Do not guess on the FAFSA. If you have a question, post here or [contact the Federal Student Aid Info Center](https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact).",2021-08-26 00:27:46

Before, my grants and minimal federal loans were paying for my expenses quite well, but when my moms alcoholism started getting bad, there happened to be an issue with my FAFSA and some missing tax information. I tried getting my mom to help me find the appropriate tax forms but she was always too incapacitated and I had no clue what I was looking for or how to get it, so it all ended up on the back burner. 

I tried contacting the school during February or March 2021 and they said it was too late, I was no longer considered a student and therefore would be ineligible to get federal aid or aid through the school to pay off my outstanding balance of $10k. 

Now it's been 2 years, I've been working really hard on fixing my personal and family issues and I'm ready to go back hopefully summer of 2023. I already plan on calling my schools admissions and financial aid offices tomorrow, but is there anything you could recommend I do??

I‚Äôve also decided to just focus on and rekindle past friendships (people who actually care about me). I also just want to note that I didn‚Äôt wrong them in any way. This all just started when I moved out. 

So I'm in a group of 6 friends, but of late I feel like they've been purposely leaving me out. We were all roommates but I moved out of the house due to financial difficulties, and now it seems they all know inside jokes that I don't, they all have more experiences together without me. 

We agreed to meet up for lunch and chat today, but they left without me(two of them drive and one was supposed to pick me up) without even giving me a heads up I'm scared to confront them about this. I don't have any other friends at school. And I feel like if I do bring it up, they'll turn it against me

It's possible they are leaving you out of things intentionally, because your former roommates no longer feel that you are a member of the core friend group, but it's also possible they are discussing plans in person, verbally, and it doesn't occur to them to separately invite you along.  

I suggest you try to maintain a friendship with the specific members of this group whom you are closest to. Invite them to lunch one on one, or ask them if they want to join a club with you, or a rec sports team. You can't force the whole group of five or six other people to include you in all of their social plans, but you can build a close friendship with specific individuals by being proactive and asking them to do things with you.

I registered for two classes that were required for my major this semester at the top of the semester, and they even displayed a professor that was supposed to be in charge of instructing the class. However, when the semester started, we were informed that they had not had someone to instruct the course, and the person whom was originally listed was only a placeholder. The department chair informed us the class would be transitioned into a mini-term course.

So when Spring Break comes and goes, and the miniterm starts again, I reached out to the department chair as the class still wasn‚Äôt started. I was informed that they were in the process of hiring the professor. That leads us to now, a week before grades are due for graduating seniors. The school finally hired the teacher and he is now attempting to fit 45 hours per class into the span of a week and a half. That is 90 for me, since I‚Äôm in both. There‚Äôs two other graduating seniors who are in both as well, along with two other graduating seniors who are in one of the two.

Having to study, make sure my assignments meet deadlines, meet with other students for study groups and extracurriculars made me feel like I was part of something bigger and more important. Every day, I felt like I had a reason to get out of bed.

Doing this work thing day in and day out, I constantly wonder why we subject ourselves to this kind of adult life. I know a lot of people are fine with it, but I'm terrified of decades of my life passing doing the same monotonous grind without much to show for it.

A lot of people I've spoken with about this have suggested the complete opposite: that college makes them feel like they have no purpose, but work gives them a sense of identity and fulfillment.

If UofA doesn‚Äôt have a good program for what you want to study and Duke does, then probably go to Duke. 

Do you like the weather of one place over the other? Do you care where it‚Äôs at? Is being involved in sports something you care about? Do you have connections at either place? These are all things to consider.

271,t1_l01y0dj,1713390788.0,"I heard that even in professional settings, that ‚Äúhigh school‚Äù feeling never truly goes away. 

I might get downvoted for this haha. But I‚Äôm actually in support of talking to them. 

The word ‚Äúconfronting‚Äù is usually associated with negative feelings that could make it seem like you‚Äôre risking everything. If you look at it with the perspective of ‚Äúthey‚Äôre my friends, I should just tell them how I feel‚Äù it feels less doomy and could make it a bit more comfortable to open up to them. Word choice is really key. 

For example, instead of saying ‚Äúyou guys make me feel left out‚Äù you could say ‚ÄúI have been feeling left out‚Äù or ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm missing out‚Äù. When we begin with ‚Äúyou‚Äù or the other person, it makes them feel like you‚Äôre attacking them causing an unproductive dialogue. Instead, tell them how YOU feel. Because in the end, we really don‚Äôt know what the other person thinks or has to say and starting off with ‚Äúyou‚Äù makes it seem accusatory, and we really only know how we feel. When they say ‚Äúwhy do you feel left out‚Äù you can always answer with ‚Äúi notice that I‚Äôm not understanding inside jokes or that I‚Äôm not participating in events that have been planned, and I just want to know why.‚Äù Then you can explain your perspective and they can explain theirs. It‚Äôs about understanding, not so much about who is right or wrong because nothing is EVER black and white. I‚Äôve learned this the hard way. 

Discussing how you feel doesn‚Äôt have to be confrontational. And besides, when you open up just a little in this way, you will absolutely know if they are your friends or not. One thing I learned in therapy is that your feelings are not facts. So to save your mental health and unnecessary conflict, it‚Äôs always best to just talk it out and ask because believer it or not, most of the time we are overreacting. Lastly, if things don‚Äôt turn out well, you can always be proud that you advocated for yourself and your boundaries. It‚Äôs a win in my book. 

Good luck.",2024-04-17 17:53:08

However, and this is a big however, you are only young once. Being in a relationship at high school/college age is a special kind of wonderful you won't get again.

Do you think maybe you are overdoing it? Why do you give so much to every friendship? Do you think those people wouldn't be your friend if you didn't give?

I think if you want a friend that you can have that super close and caring connection with, you should pick a single friend and really focus on spending time with them and getting to know them, maybe even at the cost of some of your relationships with other people. You don't have to give to all of your friends because a lot of friendships aren't ones where people really expect to give or take, they are surface level. If you want a give and take friendship, you've really got to invest into one person to make them care about you.

432,t3_1c6zhf9,1713434318.0,"Hey there Reddit people ! I (21M) think its about time that I ask for help. I would really appreciate if you read all of it.

As a kid, I was very jolly, happy and full of life. I had many friends. As recent as my class 10th, I had a nice group of close friends. We did everything together and we are still in contact through socials as we are now in different colleges. So I know how it feels to be in company of nice friends. 

But after 10th, we started studying for competitive exams in our home isolation which was traumatizing and full of taunts and then covid lockdown struck as well and after all of that, the person that I have come out as now, is absolutely opposite to what I was.

When I joined my Engineering college in 2021, It was difficult for me to make friends. Obviously there were students with different personalities and I couldn't fit in with everyone. I observed everyone for a while and tried networking with a few but it just won't work. They were always close to each other more than me. I always felt ignored and uninvited. Leaving my self respect aside, I even tried changing friend groups to feel liked somewhere but nobody includes me with them.

I am not cool like them. I dont drink and smoke. I dont go to parties and clubs. I am already shy and introverted &amp; I think after those two years of isolation, I have also become a serious faced, boring person. And people cannot relate to me anymore. I have no personality.

People around me are having huge friend groups. They are always seen together, talking and laughing. They go out to watch movies and on trips. They have girlfriends and boyfriends who love them and what not. I don't even have a friend circle. I have become a loner.

I really want people to love me and invite me to their plans. I want friends who treat me with respect. Who share secrets. Who play sports together. Who study together. Who dont make me feel left out.

And the joke is, I am writing all this, when college is almost about to finish. I am in my 7th Sem now. I am writing all this so that I dont f*** up like this after college too. I dont want to become that ""loner"" guy that is just there in some corner doing his work like a donkey.

Recently, everyone was moving out of hostels to take an accommodation somewhwere outside college. Everyone invited and gathered their friend circle of 4-5 people, and shifted in flats and PGs together. And then there's me. As I had absolutely no friends who I could shift with, I am living in college hostel with some fellow loners. 

I can't believe what I have done to myself. Maybe I am a bit old school. Maybe I have no idea how to make friends in this generation. Please please please give me some genuine tips of what should I change about myself so that people around me includes me in their circle and make me an important part of their life.

445,t1_l04lsm1,1713439319.0,"I'm a professor, and I have worked with students on big projects, like a thesis or a conference paper.


My perspective is very different from theirs (and yours). They tend to see their projects sort of like you do -- as this huge thing that says something big about them, personally. It gets tied up with their sense of worth. They are afraid that if someone sees problems with the thesis, it means that they are some sort of fraud.


I don't see it that way at all. I think a thesis is often the biggest project a student has undertaken. They are trying to apply their research skills, and trying to think analytically, and trying to organize a big project -- and all of these are hard. The thesis isn't ""proof that I have everything completely figured out."" It is just a big project that helps you to develop and demonstrate your skills -- even if those skills are still imperfect.¬†


I see student projects all the time with flaws. (I mean, I see professional projects with flaws, too. Including mine.) Maybe the organization is not great, or the evidence doesn't point the way that the student thinks it does, or there is a super-relevant article out there that the student hasn't consulted. I see it as my job to guide the student through these problems, not condemn them for having difficulties.


A thesis doesn't have to be a work of staggering genius. The mantra that got me (and all my friends) through grad school was this: ""The best dissertation is a done dissertation."" By working on your thesis, you are learning new things, and that's the point. It doesn't have to be perfect to be worthy.¬†",2024-04-18 07:21:59

As of right now I am in my second semester of college. Last semester I earned two B‚Äôs and a C that I am trying to fight a grade appeal on, but haven‚Äôt gotten anywhere. This semester I have an A and three C‚Äôs, and the end of the semester is literally next week.

This is due to multiple reasons. I work 30+ hours a week along with commuting to school, which doesn‚Äôt leave me with much time. I have pretty piss poor time management skills as well, but I think the most impactful part is the fact I have god awful study skills. During grade school I had never needed to study because the material came to me naturally 99% of the time, and thus I never really learned how to study efficiently for exams and such. This has come around to bite me in the ass in college. 

It‚Äôs definitely been discouraging, but I am still determined to continue. I have learned a lot of things about myself over these past two semesters that will help a lot in the future. I learned that I lose focus easily and it‚Äôs very difficult for me to maintain the same level of focus on a class that lasts the full semester if it‚Äôs not stem, so I plan on taking accelerated courses. I am taking a handful over the summer that are easier to manage and plan to use some extra time to study and get better with some algebra/pre cal stuff that I‚Äôm rusty on to better prepare for harder classes next semester.

I‚Äôm mostly just hoping that college kicking my ass this hard won‚Äôt fuck me over too badly in the future. I think I bit off a little bit more than I can chew with how I planned some stuff out previously, but I should be able to fix it/make the best of it. Thanks for reading my Ted talk.

So my work-study says that I'm supposed to make about $2,000 a semester. However, I've made a little bit more than that. My job pays $10.50 an hour and I always work the maximum 20 hours a week, meaning that I earn $800 a month and about $3,200 a semester.

From what I understand, when you look at your financial aid and see your work-study offer it's just giving you an estimated amount that you can expect from work-study. Realistically everyone will earn a different amount due to different wages and working different hours. The total it shows you isn't the limit, it's trying to show you what you can expect in terms of financial assistance from your work-study.

However, there is still a limit. I don't know what y'all use as your work application but we use something called ""PeopleSoft"". That's basically where we clock-in, check our timesheets, stuff like that. On PeopleSoft there's a section that goes over the details of your employment and it should say what the limit is that you're allowed to make in one year.

Other things to try: 
*Become an RA in your dorm 
*Sign up with admissions to be the campus rep/tour guide for transfers
*Volunteer somewhere nearby...girls like puppies so it's a good place to start
*Find a geekswhodrink trivia night at a bar nearby (you don't have to drink) and ask to join a group ""I'm a transfer student and don't know anyone yet, mind if I join your group?"" You'll probably be invited to join the week after. 
*Join an intermural sport: flag football, kickball, sand volleyball, softball. Sign up and they put free agents on teams 
*Take your work to a coffeeshop...find one with longer community tables that you have to share with someone 
*Use your question of what to do in this thread as your reason for approaching people at your college and around you. ""I just transferred here and don't know anyone, have any social things to recommend where I can meet people? It's super isolating not having my friends at school here, someone to grab a meal/drink.."" or just ""You up for a drink/ grabbing food sometime, I just transfered here and don't know anyone yet..?"" You'll be surprised how people might react. Invite you along. Take the win. Initiate something else a week or two later. 
*Go to the fitness rec center. Workout it will help with endorphins and lift your mood and give you a Segway. Find someone in your same weight class/fit type and ask if they're interested in being spotting partners/accountability partners/workout buddies to help the other stay motivated because you've always enjoyed fitness more with a partner. 
*And just watch people. If you stop concentrating on how awkward you feel you'll start noticing others that feel the same way. Those are your people. Approach them. Don't try to blend in with the group of friends that have known each other since kindergarten that's an impossible fortress to penetrate.  (#nonewfriends). 
*Find/form a Meetup to take a walk in the evenings 

My guess is you're trying too hard and being too formal. And maybe you expect to be turned down so you carry yourself with some tension. Relax, smile.

At a coffeeshop: (to other person also studying) *let out a big sigh then a smile ""Ever feel like the more you study the less you know?"" Introduce yourself only after talking back and forth a few times almost off-handed.  In class: (to the person next to you) ""He/She (the professor) had me at _____ but lost me at ______. Are you able to stick with it all the way through?!!""  And the thing is you look at them when you start the conversation then look back ahead then back at them to punctuate the question mark.  The focus is the conversation and not them. Sometimes formalities can seem awkward and transactional. Like the end of a conversation always seems weird how to say bye. So just say ""catch ya later or cheers or see you around"" and leave. Though I can understand when you feel super isolated you want a friend so bad but you can't force one to start by magic.  It's about making contact over and over until it gives way to something natural. 

Keep going and don't give up.",2024-04-18 12:36:10

Granted I figured this out freshman year, but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with realizing you don‚Äôt like what you are doing. 

I would advise going to your advisor ASAP. Since it is your second year, you might have to take an extra class during a semester or two of a summer class. But that depends on what each major requires, which your advisor should be familiar with. I would also discuss with your advisor that you are struggling with picking a new major. Think of classes you did and did not like and classes you did and did not like in high school. Advisors should really help walking you through it. If you have one, I would also contact the career center who could go into what major leads to what job fields. And they could also probably help in narrowing down your choices",2024-04-18 12:36:56

Think about your discipline and the types of courses you're taking too. If's you're in a 300-person large lecture classes right now, you're going to see a lot of lecturing. It shifts to more active learning as you move to advanced classes and the course sizes shrink. 

Do you want to gonto grad school? If yes, it's a good idea to foster in-person relationships with faculty who can become mentors, PIs, or write letters of recommendation. 

Also, if you're in any discipline with hands on components, take the classes in-person. For example, there was someone who posted a few weeks back asking if they should take an online or in-person acting class. Obviously, you get better preparation acting in-person.

524,t1_l0635zv,1713459520.0,"You're just out of practice.  

My advice: start practicing relating to people that you don't fear rejection from.  It's easy to get intimidated by our peers and think they are so much cooler when we feel inadequate, boring, etc. So challenge yourself to strike up conversations with Uber drivers, waiters, baristas, people in line, on the bus, etc. Who cares if they think you're boring or obnoxious or ridiculous? The point is to practice opening yourself up. So when you do approach people on campus it feels more natural. Just ask a random off-handed question ""You seem to know where everything is, how long have you been working here?"" ""What would you recommend?"" ""What name do you get the most? (Starbucks barista always writes names)"" ""Sorry to bother you, I'm trying to decide between ______ and ______ (movie), have you seen either?"" Don't start with your name or hi just throw something out for them to remark on and let it flow. Hell volunteer at an old folks home and share some love. They're dying (literally) for conversation and have super cool stories they want to tell before they go and wouldn't judge you in the least as you gain your footing. When your confidence grows then try it on campus. 

And secondly, be genuinely interested in getting to know other people and not just making a friend if that makes sense. When you have an agenda it comes through and is off-putting. Forget the end desire and just show interest in others instead of concentrating on who you lack and how you feel. When people feel seen they are more appreciative of you and inclusive and in turn reciprocate by giving attention back. Ask them questions about themselves and remark on answers.

538,t3_1c79m4z,1713462437.0,"Hello, I'm a music major at a small community college. My focus is voice, and I've been studying it for three years so far. This is where I got my very first voice professor, who I liked a lot at first. But my journey has been slow, and as time went on, she began treating me worse and worse. When it became clear that I wasn't progressing at a desirable rate, at least not compared to my classmates, she started losing faith in me and absolutely did let it show. She's said things to me that have made me want to quit, I've come out of lessons crying. The worst part is, I don't even know if I'm overreacting or not. She's normalized this stuff so much that I've started to think, maybe this is just what voice is like. Maybe I just can't take criticism. That's what she's been suggesting, that maybe I can't handle it. I can't trust myself anymore; she's the PhD after all, shouldn't she know best? I just want to know if I just can't take criticism, or if there's really something wrong going on here. 
These are some of the things she's told me:
She's told me that I'm not even at a freshman level yet, and that I wouldn't be able to pass an audition. This was this year. She said that even if I did, the school I got into wouldn't let me graduate and would just take my money. She discouraged me from auditioning by saying ""I'd like to tell you that you'd do well in an audition, but I don't want to lie to you."" That one made me give up on applying for auditions and colleges until very recently. Before this semester I sent her a friendly email detailing some of the things I was going to do to help me progress, and she sent back five paragraphs about how I shouldn't be in voice, I wouldn't get into a school, and that I haven't been doing the work to improve. Even though I stay here for 9 to 10 hours almost every day making sure I get my practice in. She said that at this point, it looks like I'm ""either unwilling or incapable"". And that's just not true, it's the only thing I can be sure isn't true because I'm so willing that I stay until 7 some days. But the fact that I'm still progressing so slowly is making me think, what if she's right that I shouldn't be singing? And what if she was right that I should find another field in music to pursue instead? I get treated like a scapegoat outside of lessons too, which makes me even more discouraged. 
Is this really how some professors act? I know there are some hardasses out there, but I feel so conflicted because she's so sweet and harmless on the outside. I never believe anyone when they say I sound good because my teacher says I'm not there yet. Today she actually said that I have gotten better, but that it was the first good performance that I've given in a long time.
Am I being too sensitive? It's true that I have a long way to go and I'm not as good as I should be by now. But I work really hard, and I wish I could hear some more good things about myself from her every so often. I'm graduating in May so I don't have to endure it much longer, but still...",2024-04-18 13:47:17

None of this sounds like constructive criticism, but it would help to have another expert evaluate what could be going on. Its possible you professor is just unreasonably toxic, but you need to find out for sure.

You're putting in a lot of hours practicing- what exactly are you not improving in? Is it possible you are practicing the wrong techniques or in the wrong way? Do you have deficiencies in skills that would be expected at your level? Is there anything physiologically different about your voice which is a barrier? I don't know how common this is, but I went pretty far in classical voice, but my voice itself seemed to have some physiological limitations that capped my potential below the professional level.

If you can find any other voice coach or professor willing to do an evaluation and give you a second option that would be invaluable.

If I were you I'd also ask to sit down with this professor and you get to the bottom of her complaints. Make sure you understand specifically what her concerns are, ie what specific things are you lacking. Politely tell her that you aren't sure how to interpret statements that you aren't doing work to improve because you are doing X things for Y hours a week -- ask what she would recommend doing to improve, and if you could be focusing on the wrong things. I'd also privately ask your classmates about their training routines to see how you compare &amp; make sure you're not just putting in enough hours but that those hours are targeted at the right kind of practice.¬†

554,t1_l06hztt,1713464424.0,"Music school is kinda notorious for abusive and toxic advisor/private lesson relationships. See the movie whiplash for some cathartic stuff. It allowed me some room to be a little more critical of my toxic music school advisor after seeing that movie.

I had a similar experience when I did my undergrad in music performance. The guy I was taking lessons from and advising me had all sorts of lofty ideas for what I would be doing with a music performance degree, but was hilariously out of touch with the current trends in the industry. He was still pushing orchestra auditions and cruise ship gigs as if either were good options that could pay bills or provide a reasonable quality of life, assuming that I even won an audition. Which is hilariously competitive, i.e. 100-200 people audition for an single spot, many of which are in there 30s with PHDs and a decade of daily practice.  
  
If I could redo it, I would change advisors to someone who wasn't so abusive and toxic. There are probably a half a dozen other voice teachers in your school, I would recommend seeing if you can change over to them. You don't deserve to be gaslit and belittled by this voice teacher. 

Crying is not normal, but I will be honest that I had similar experiences, and all of the other students in my studio had similar experiences with our professor. None of us deserved his abuse, and it was absolutely not worth the suffering. I could have got a degree piece of paper from pretty much anyone and it would have been worth the same.

Your vocal coach sounds like they are withholding praise to get you to work harder and spend more time trying to get better at performing. Which... ok... but the reality of the music industry is pretty toxic even if you are an amazing vocalist.

\_\_\_

  
Not sure if this helps but here is a timeline of how I ended up spending 4 years of my life in a toxic relationship in music school, still working on recovering via talk therapy now over 10 years later.

Freshman year: I placed in all the top ensembles and got a constant stream of compliments and approval from most of my ensemble directors and main advisor.

Sophomore year: I placed into even better ensembles but my advisor was starting to get super abusive and nitpicky and a real downer. 

Junior year: some grad students showed up in my studio and were indeed better musicians than me, taking the top ensemble spots. Advisor became increasingly abusive and I became depressed. Realistically I was probably depressed before this...

Senior year: advisor handed me off to the grad students for individual lessons, I was pretty mad about it, but they were way less abusive than he was. I stopped participating in the jazz bands as it wasn't required for graduating. I did the bare minimum in all my classes, graduated and moved back in with my parents.

\_\_\_

Post graduation, I floundered around and got fired from six jobs within a year, all front line customer service jobs, restaurants, hospitality, call centers, etc. Eventually managed to leverage family network into an entry level IT job at a public school. Lots of talk therapy and group therapy, and improving my IT career skills later, I am pretty happy and content and have a lot of things figured out.

You don't deserve to be in an abusive relationship with someone who absolutely does not hold the keys to your future. The music industry is so fucked, that even if you were the best voice student in your program and your vocal teacher was great and you liked them, you still wouldn't end up with a job that pays the bills after doing grad school. Well, you might, but I know so many amazing musicians who are destitute, or hustle super hard with all sorts of side jobs to make ends meet. 

If you really want to make it as a vocalist, you need to be in LA, Nashville, or NYC. Thats it, there are no other options. Well, I suppose other countries have their equivalents. If you aren't willing to be a starving artist hustling in those extremely expensive places, its probably time to start thinking about what you are going to do with your career, whatever it ends up being. If you can end up with that undergrad degree, change lesson teachers to someone not abusive, and then figure out your early 20s path to a career, it should work out in the end. If your parents are rich though, the rules change, you can probably spend the next 10 years practicing and living in one of the above cities and eventually make it work.

But then I saw that she was letting other students do more than I did and didn't give me great information on the program, etc. She also just wasn't great at teaching by my second and third years. I felt very stagnate and never thought i'd make it into my program,She also only really knew how to teach one style of singing and I was forcee to basically learn that instead of what I wanted to learn. plus she wasn't always the most encouraging she would tell me I wasn't practicing enough or she'd get mad at me when I'd show up to a lesson time she picked. And when juries came around, most students said she would give the worst comments, and she'd even be late or miss most of her lessons for the semester. With all this, I and a couple of other students all had the courage to leave this voice teacher and OMG. The improvement i've seen within my own and other people has been insane. I'd say report what your teacher is saying to you and switch vocal teachers. Being with a teachee that won't make you feel stuck/guilty makes all the difference  even though i'm leaving the program for these problems i'm glad I switched and learned what I have from this new professor feels like I've made up for a bit of lost time with my old voice teacher.

592,t3_1c7c07b,1713468153.0,"I have lab first thing in the morning, but today I overslept and by the time I arrived at campus to submit my homework, the lab classroom was empty.

Lab normally ends 1 hour early than scheduled which seemed normal to me (idk I‚Äôve never taken one before this semester) since students never had issues or delays with experiments. So instead of 9-12, we run from 9-11 AM.

Since the classroom was empty, and lab office hours were prior to the lab, I decided to go to the lecture professor‚Äôs office hours which were currently ongoing (the lecture occurs after the lab at 12:30), to see if he‚Äôd be able to either receive my homework or pass it on to the lab professor if she‚Äôs still on campus‚Ä¶ since they both lead the same course.

When I tried to submit my homework to the lecture prof, he made a weird face and asked why I couldn‚Äôt just hand it to the lab prof. I told him lab was over and the room was empty. He questioned me on the time I arrived at campus (11:20) and if lab always ended this early. With every answer, his face grew increasingly more‚Ä¶ shocked? Agitated? I don‚Äôt know it felt like I had said something I wasn‚Äôt supposed to.

He wanted to travel to the lab professor‚Äôs office to ‚Äúsee‚Äù if she was there and they both looked surprised to see each other. She was eating / watching something.

Since it wasn‚Äôt my lab professor‚Äôs office hours, I quickly apologized for my actions and handed her my papers hoping to get out of her hair but she seemed out of it the entire time and barely responded.

That whole interaction felt strange, I‚Äôm not sure what to make of it. I‚Äôve overlslept before but not by this much so I wouldn‚Äôt fault my lab professor for officially disliking me after today for whichever reason.

Edit: My lab professor is really nice. I know this incident was out of my control‚Ä¶ but had I known she would still be here or where her office was, I would‚Äôve just gone to her directly. Is there a way I can redeem myself?",2024-04-18 15:22:33

594,t1_l06tejm,1713468185.0,"Voice major here. I‚Äôm lucky to have a great voice professor, but I‚Äôve heard a lot of horror stories, even in my own school. Ultimately, you know yourself and your voice best, so I‚Äôm not going to tell you what you should do, but here are some perspectives to consider:

1.) If she is not getting anywhere with you, especially after three years in, it‚Äôs probably easier for her to blame it on you instead of accepting that her teaching style isn‚Äôt working on you and she will likely need to modify her approach with you to see results. Some people just need that, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it. If she‚Äôs not willing to tailor YOUR lessons to YOU, then it might be time to find someone else to teach you - a new professor at the same school, or take a risk and transfer schools!

2.) If you are putting the hours in and practicing as you should be (i.e. not goofing off and playing the piano in the practice room (we all do it üòú)), then the only thing you can do is your best. But, make note of what habits you are actually building into yourself and HOW you‚Äôre practicing. You‚Äôre obviously not happy with where you‚Äôre at, and neither is your teacher, so maybe try switching some things up in your practice. For starters, please don‚Äôt practice more than 2 hours a day MAXIMUM. Your voice will get tired out, swollen, and you won‚Äôt be as productive. I like to do an hour to an hour-and-fifteen at a time. No longer than that. Prioritize, do the stuff, then get out of the practice room. Rest your voice, take care of yourself, etc. Chronically swollen vocal folds from over-practicing can really stunt your growth and progress since your voice is in ‚Äúsurvival mode‚Äù.

3.) I had a professor one who said some really nasty things to me, and I found out later that it was an attempt to motivate me to be better. Try an audition, do something to show her that you‚Äôre willing to put in the work. She might be eagerly waiting for you to rise to the challenge and prove her wrong!

4.) The real world is full of people like this - she may just be preparing you for it. I do believe that at the collegiate level, it‚Äôs better to be honest with students than to try to sugarcoat everything. She just may be trying to give you a accurate perception of yourself and where you‚Äôre at RIGHT NOW. That being said, though, having a growth mindset (instead of a fixed mindset) is the biggest asset you can have in this field. If she‚Äôs right and everything she‚Äôs saying is true and you know it deep down, the best thing you can do for yourself is to just accept it and move on. It‚Äôll be painful; it‚Äôll make you want to quit. But once you accept the reality of the situation, you‚Äôve officially started the journey to improvement.

5.) On the other hand‚Ä¶if the things she‚Äôs saying are blatant lies and you know it, do something about it. Report it to someone, record your lessons so you have proof, make a push to switch teachers, whatever you need to do. You won‚Äôt be able to grow in an environment that is holding you back. You‚Äôre paying for the degree, so get your money‚Äôs worth by working with someone who actually wants you to learn.

6.) There could be some miscommunication happening. Having a conversation with her if you feel you need it never hurts :) 

Those are just some thoughts. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this; it sounds really discouraging and frustrating. Best of luck to you on this journey! üéµüéºüé∂üé§",2024-04-18 15:23:05

613,t3_1c7clu3,1713469614.0,"Hello, for context, I'm 19M at my freshmen year at the University of Wyoming, and I have Asperger's Syndrome-or high functioning autism for short. At our university, we are required to live on the campus dorms for our first year, and in these dorms, they're all shared, so, typically, there's two people generally sharing a room. 

Our dorms are built from the sixties, so despite their aesthetic appeal (I love that type of architecture) it makes for a very unattractive living situation, so you can easily hear your neighbours conversation, the elevators are slow and sometimes don't work, and the building seems like it's falling into disrepair. Despite this, I generally like my universety, and I'm grateful that my dad worked too pay for my first semester and half of this one (I cover the other half myself.) 

This past semester, I really struggled and failed. I was suicidal for a couple of weeks in October, but during this period I wouldn't really do anything. I would hardly leave the room, and I felt so guilty. Even talking about it makes me fairly depressed. However, as a result, I thought that I was a shitty roommate because I hardly left, so this lead me to ""oversee"" many of my roommates behaviour because I thought I would be hypocritical. 

In the past month, I've gotten my act together. I'm going to class, studying, and putting in the work along with trying to balance my part-time job at our dining centre on campus. I want to be a successful student, and I want to learn. It's been years since I've felt this way. I finally don't feel depressed and hopeless. 

Well, at least I was... 

A month ago, my roommate started snoring severely during the night. This went on for several nights before I told him that it was happening. He told me his dad has sleep apena (so does mine), so I suggested he gets it checked out. It got so bad I could close the door, and hear him a door or two over still in the hallway. I told him it would help if he could sleep on his front or side, but this wasn't an issue (I didn't make it one rather) because it's not his fault, and I was just trying to let him know that was happening. 

More recently, however, things have gotten worse. As I've tried to pull myself out of this academic hole, it's became more apperant to me how awful and inconsiderate he is as a roommate. For the past four nights, he's kept me up (bare minimum) until 1am. On average, it's nearly 2am until he stops playing video games. Now, I don't really have an issue with that-it's his life and consequences at the end of the day; however, when that starts to affect me, it's an issue. As he plays his games, he is always taking to his friends. He laughs, screams, and in general makes noises that keep me up. Sometimes, he's woken me up because of this. When I've already fallen asleep. I could be asleep for two hours, and he'll just wake me up. Last week, I asked him, politely, if he had any issues with me. He said no. He said I was an ""good"" roommate. Additionally, I told him if he has any problems with me, too just let me know about them. He also said that, he tries to be considerate towards me, but I find that statement silly. 

I've been trying to let him know about his behaviour: I told him about this last week, I've slammed the door on him whenever he shows up now, I stay out of the room way more, and I've blocked his ass from all my social media. I only have his phone number until I don't have to live with him anymore. 


He doesn't ever clean up the room, go to classes, never doesn't not cheat on his assigments (dude is a fucking education major), and he talks like he's in the seventh grade. I'm not joking. My grades are starting to slip because of him keeping me up. I missed my fucking classes yesterday, and I've been feeling like shit recently. I miss ya dad ;(

So I have done some searching and haven‚Äôt been able to find the proper source that could help me but then I found this thread and I‚Äôm hoping someone can point me in the direction that may help my next move towards a biology or geology degree. 

Background:

I have a bachelors of fine arts degree in Design. Obviously, this isn‚Äôt applicable to biology and geology. I currently am laid off from my design job and I have realized that I‚Äôm not happy where I‚Äôm at in my career. I also recently was diagnosed with ADHD. I have always been drawn to biology and geology, but because I was younger and undiagnosed, I thought I was too stupid to learn sciences. I want to give my inner child that second chance now that I have the proper resources.  

My areas of interest specifically are plants and fungi. My niche loves are mushrooms, moss, lichen and liverworts. I also have passions for geology; specifically minerals and volcanos. I had looked into Geobiology as a focus but based on my research it doesn‚Äôt look like a successful career goal as the field is declining unfortunately. 

I am really not sure what I want to focus on, so I figured I will once I start pursuing a degree, with a primary focus on biology and secondary focus on geology. 

It seems like there are colleges that are perfect for biology and some perfect for geology but I am not sure if there are any colleges that are good for both?

I also have an issue with money. I really don‚Äôt have the money for college, although I am looking into grants and financing. I am looking into auditing classes, as well as buying all the books I can. Since it is April I don‚Äôt expect being able to start courses until the fall. I also expect that most deadlines for admissions has passed as well. 

Any advice for me based on what I said above would be so helpful. Even if it‚Äôs to point me in the direction of a specific type of person that could help me like an advisor? 

All I know is that I am made for something more than what I am doing now and my passion for nature and learning how the earth works is motivating me to continue on that path.

Thank you for whoever reads this and responds. It means the world.

If I accept the conservatory acceptance I can also get a major in psychology (BM with a major in psych) but if I just go to university I could not major in music (just graduating with a BA). 

I would really like to continue music, but I would also like to get a masters in psych after graduating. Will getting a BM with a major in psych make it harder to compete for a spot at a top school for psychology? Should I just get the BA if I want to be a competitive applicant to top grad schools even if it means not continuing music? Im also concerned that if I only major in psychology I‚Äôll miss out on research opportunities.

Ocassional shorter days are to be expected. An hour purposesly cut off daily is a problem. This is not your fault. But...if I were a Provost, I would have some questions for the Dean.

If I were the Chair of the department, I would have questions for ALL of the faculty to make sure this is the exception and not the norm. If I'm the faculty member in question, I should anticipate a conversation about how well I'm running my class and lab. If I'm the TA, I'm looking to provide a very good reason why I should be the TA, the next semester.

Then the entire campus gets some mysterious ""reminder"" by the Provost via email about the importance of keeping classes and labs for their entire time...with everyone wondering what's going on, who screwed up and everybody behaves for a minute. That's Scenario#1.

Well since then I always knew I wanted a degree but have no idea in what. I did decide however that Nursing doesn't seem like something I can see myself doing.  I currently work in state government doing admin support type of work. So I thought of a business degree since I already have my feet in the door? - But is this really what I want? I don't want to waste my time with a degree that I won't use since I'm 31 already. 

I have two kids now and do not have a spouse our boyfriend. So, I appreciate the M-F work hours to spend time with them on the weekend.

Hello, I am just reaching out to apologize for my lack of attendance in the two most recent classes.¬†

This semester, right around the start of project two I realized I had bitten off a bit more than I could chew credit hour/class-wise. This realization came too late, and in turn, while not necessarily intentional your class unfortunately got placed on the back burner. While I plan on having the final draft submitted on time this Sunday (04/21/2024), I am reaching out to ask if I‚Äôm still ok to submit the now (extremely) tardy portions that made up the rest of Project Two. Given your already lenient late policy on all assignments, I would entirely understand these submissions not being allowed but figured I would reach out and ask anyway as per the syllabus.¬†

677,t3_1c7gkas,1713479104.0,"I started out at community college for a year and a half and then changed my major. Switched to a university and have been here for 3.5 years. 

I am supposed to finish this semester, then take a couple online summer courses and graduate in August. 

It‚Äôs the end of the spring semester and there are two classes that I am just barely passing. I‚Äôve attended almost every single class and get A‚Äôs on all the homework‚Äôs (writing assignments usually) but I‚Äôve been completely tanking the exams. I have been studying a lot for them and for weeks in advance. I just don‚Äôt perform well with tests/exams. I‚Äôve never been good in school so I don‚Äôt know why I put myself in this situation. 

If I don‚Äôt pass these two classes, I would have to come back next year to take them because they‚Äôre in person only (one of them is only offered in the spring). But I‚Äôve reached my financial aid limit and can‚Äôt afford to pay out of pocket. I also live with my parents three hours away from the university but my temporary off campus apartment lease is up next month.

Now I‚Äôve accumulated 153k in student loan debt and may not even get my degree. If I don‚Äôt pass these two classes I will probably give up on it. If I could go back I would never ever go to college. 

And I feel like I can‚Äôt even bitch about this because it‚Äôs the consequences of my own actions. I did this to myself. I don‚Äôt know what else to do.  ",2024-04-18 18:25:04

For one, I can‚Äôt accept the fact that I had no idea how to submit a college application and although I asked for help it was relatively useless. The reason why I am considering this is because I know I can do so much more. For one, my counselor told me not to apply through QuestBridge (although my family makes &lt; 30k) and she also told me to not even try to apply to prestigious schools and to do in state schools. I live in Texas, so I applied to all the schools I could and well, it ended in disappointment. Rejected from my major at UT and Rice, I felt like a failure because I worked so hard throughout high school just to realize that I couldn‚Äôt go to a high ranked university. It constantly bugs me every day thinking that I couldve done so much more and been so much more. For reference, I only got into UH, Baylor, UTD, A&amp;M, TCU, SMU, and Texas Tech. For reference, here are my stats:

Rank: 2/427

GPA: 4.77/5.0 W, 4.0/4.0 UW

ECS: Several leadership positions (NHS, NTHS, MHS, SOCCER), Marketing internship,  and several other organizations.


So the main question is: Should I try reapplying to more schools (through QuestBridge as well) or spend a year at one of the universities above (I am a finance major and received full rides to 3 of these universities).

686,t3_1c7gv67,1713479884.0,"I decided to take a gap year during the middle of my Fall 2023 semester. Due to reasons outside of my control, I lost my method of transportation to school about halfway through the semester. I worked with my professors to find alternative ways to attend and submit work for the classes but to little success. I fell too far behind and decided that a full withdrawal was my best option to avoid damaging my GPA. I decided to take a gap year and focus on remote work so that I could afford to transport myself to school in the future. I am now at the point where transportation is no longer a concern and I feel ready to go back to school.

&amp;#x200B;

I registered tonight but I was disappointed to discover that I will need an extra semester to complete my degree due to the credits I lost out on when I withdrew from the university. I don't have enough savings to pay for the extra semester and I would like to avoid student loans at all costs. I do not qualify for financial aid and I do not have anyone willing to help me foot the cost.

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering reaching out to the university to explain my situation and possibly ask if the last semester (or the next one) could be discounted due to my withdrawal and circumstances outside of my control. As it is, my transportation was spotty at best during the Fall '23 semester, so I did not even attend many of the classes. Does anyone have experience with this sort of thing? Is it likely that I could get a discounted rate based on the fact that I paid for an entire semester that I could barely attend? I am willing to write a detailed letter to whomever it may concern explaining the situation but I'd rather not waste everyone's time if this is not something that colleges normally do.

I'm 21(F) from Brazil, and I'm currently struggling with ""the early twenties crisis"". Last year I enrolled in an online Religious Studies course at a private college (my only option since I live in the countryside and currently can't move to a big city). Due to personal reasons, I took a break but now I'm looking forward to coming back because I'm sure I've found my passion; the classes are awesome and I love everything about it. The problem is, I started to get kinda worried about what are my options after finishing college. I've asked a professor, and he told me that I could be a teacher (I'd be really happy, but the salary is not that great, and life quality is a big priority to me because I want to support my family. Also, I don't know if being a Religious Studies professor would be that easy here in Brazil, probably due to lack of opportunities) or a researcher. This second option caught my attention, but I don't properly know how it works. Any researchers here to help? How did you guys get a job? Is it worth it? I know life is not all about money, but we need it to live with dignity, and I'm currently considering a big change and getting a Pharmacy Degree (doesn't suit me at all but is easier to make money, and also easier to make me depressed for giving up my dreams, haha :c).

I can't study, I don't want to study neither do my assignments. Just the idea of it makes me cry.

I wasn't like that, I was a hardworking student but last semester I realised I hate what I'm studying and I even hate the jobs related. It's weird because I've never liked studying since high school and I knew it. I know I don't like biology since my 1st year of college but I'm realising it just this year(it's weird). I chose to go to college and study science because I had no choice no options. My parents said since I'm a kid that I'll go to college and work in a science field. It was an affirmation not an option. So I studied those years with a weird mindset that I don't even understand or remember. My last mindset : I study hard to get good grades, I have to pass the years. If I pass one semester of college then I'll pass the other one. I'll do that until it ends.

I've spent my life doing things I hate thinking that once I finish school and college I'll finally have the right to live my life as I want. The thing is that mindset doesn't work anymore, I'm too aware of the hartred I have towards college.

I want to finish this semester and graduate because I want to at least receive a diploma to compensate all the time I wasted. I also fear what my family will think about me but also what I will think about myself. The problem is that the diploma is useless because in my country I need to do 5 years in total to get a job in my field, so I have 2 years left.

This morning I cried in my bed for hours because I have to prepare 2 oral presentations plus 2 group projects for this week. I just wish I could sleep and never wake up again.

I just need to get things done but I can't bring myself to study. I'm pulling overnights just to procrastinate and end up rushing the work. Can anyone help me ?

It's the feeling of dread, maybe? That all this hard work was for nothing... and that if you do put in the hard work you're going to hate it even more. 

I tried to reduce my anxiety and procrastination by staying out of bed, reducing screen time on my phone, and going outside a little more often just to balance myself out. I don't know if that would work for you, but I would advise you to consider ways to lower your anxiety. 

I talked to a therapist and she said that my horrible procrastination was probably from anxiety. It makes things very hard to start. Being afraid of your parents reactions is probably not helping.

I‚Äôve woken up anxious every morning as to whether I‚Äôll get a C or better in this class (passing grade for major prereqs). 

How that connects to the group project is for this class, the test averages are traditionally in the 60‚Äôs but they curves the grading scale based on class average. This could mean if the class got an 86 average or something, that would be a B- so if you get lower than class average regardless, you are getting a C+ or lower.

While I was working on a PhD, I sat next to a person who was already a practicing attorney, but decided to go back to school for Information Systems instead. I think very few graduate from college settled on what we plan to do for the rest of our lives. Even though the people you know have already settled ""on a next step"" aren't guaranteed that they're going to like that direction in a few years. So, I wouldn't lose any sleep feeling behind.

I would say, daydream a bit...like when you were a small child. What makes you smile when you think of yourself in that role. Do you see yourself lecturing college students? Would you want to run your own lab? Are you a scientist at heart? Medical school? Consider taking an interest inventory. Google some and see what you come up with. Or, more than likely there is an office on campus, already setup to help students complete interest inventories.

Don't even feel tied to Biology. So what if you didn't choose a minor. Graduate school is still a possibility, if you decide it's necessary. The courses you'll need are simply the prerequisites.

No, that is reasonable for a BSN.

BSNs even in shithole rural areas at shithole facilities make at least 18-20 straight grad which is 40K. But that is absolute garbage tier worst case and you will either do better or work that for several months and move on and do better. More likely 50-80K. Some overpriced, overhyped place like NY/CA 100-180K. Even absolute trash tier, you will STILL make double your investment in 1 year. Which is more than what most programs can claim.

Bear in mind, though, that nursing school is boot camp and flunks out people and they tell people STRAIGHT UP you can't work and do this. (at least last two years). So have a support network or live cheap/dorms.

You would  be able to save a bit on that and go to a community college for ADN (1 semester prereqs, 2 yrs NS) then bridge. Going to work in 2 years and making same amount.  But the community colleges are actually MUCH TOUGHER and much more selective than the 4 years. Not all of them have dorms, though, if you need a roof doing this. Also, those programs have long wait lists because of what they offer. A 2 year ticket to the middle class.

ADNs and RNs start out making the same, but advancement into management or the cooler, much higher paying stuff they prefer/ is locked behind  BSN and/or other certs and degrees.

Speaking of waiting list, there's also logistics. I knew people who had to pay more or travel distances because of waitlists. One person I knew even had to go to school in another state then repricocity back. If Kennesaw state has accepted you, in some cases, your choice may be made (that is, if you want nursing) as people know about it and stampede the programs as it had the reputation as a ""for sure, okay paying job"". But do realize that it entails a lifestyle of constant drug tests, zero criminal records, careful with social media, shift work, and there is no ""nursing shortage"" in many areas, only a shortage of people willing to wipe poo (bedside).",2024-04-18 22:49:27

I'm a fifth-year senior at a major state university and I've noticed substantial changes in the faculty following the pandemic in my department. It's beginning to take a large emotional toll on me and I've been considering the value of education following this realization. 

I've had numerous professors within the last 2-3 years arrive to classes late, add additional coursework to an already established syllabus, cancel numerous classes that often result in 1-2 weeks of no class time, professors who cancel class for personal or professional trips, or display a general lack of respect for students. These things feel as if they come at the expense of my education. Literally and figuratively. 

I must note: student behavior has changed, too. And in ways I don't feel I must make explicit-- we're all students who directly face the strenuous college lifestyle. Perhaps this is attributing to these changes?

Besides COVID-19 and the lack of student engagement, I cannot find a solid ""answer"" to these cultural shifts on campus. Additionally, I'm struggling to recognize if this is an isolated change at my college. I understand professors are people, too. I'm not attempting to shame nor interrogate professors. Instead, I'm curious in how and/or why these cultural shifts surrounding college etiquette and expectations have changed.

Essentially, for students who have been in college for 2+ years, **have you seen these cultural shifts on campus? Changes in faculty regulations, behavior, guidelines? And, if so, how has this impacted your perception of education as an institution, or, your own academic outcomes?**",2024-04-18 23:10:30

Honestly, I'm just confused.

So, I get plagiarism‚Äîstealing others' ideas, not giving credits, etc. But, in the case of a group project where each person *also* ends up writing their *own* paper... does discussing things count as plagiarizing because it's related to each others' ideas?

Basically, I'm in a group of three people and we're doing a chemistry experiment together, and then we're each going to write our own individual papers. My question is, would discussing the results of our experiment and discussing potential ideas for the discussion section be plagiarism? And I don't mean like ""hey, look, this is what I wrote for the discussion!""‚ÄîI mean, like, just talking about it; like discussing potential conclusions or limitations to our experiment, for example.

791,t3_1c7n7jf,1713498192.0,"Here's a little backstory, I graduated high school with a 3.9 GPA, which would have been higher if I had not messed around Freshman year. I got back on track and took on several leadership roles in clubs and on sports teams during high school. My siblings all went to extremely respected universities, and are all very successful in their careers. My parents never really thought college was for me, but they still pushed me towards going, and have taken it upon themselves to help their youngest child(me), with some of the financial costs of college. I had no idea what I wanted to do after college, or even what I wanted to study, but I went in hopes I would figure those things out.

My freshman year was a great year for me, I ended up making deans list and was active in Student Government and a coed business fraternity. The issues I faced that year came from my unhappiness with my choice in the university I attended, the social group I found myself in, and the degree I chose. I decided to stick with the university and I changed degrees to something I thought I would enjoy more, but this is where things took a turn for me. Sophomore year had several issues arise, one being an extremely toxic relationship with a partner that was both physically and mentally abusive, and my grandfather fell ill suddenly and passed after a month or so of battling the disease. I was taking mostly online classes at that time, and I was the only grandchild who was physically capable of being there, so I decided to stay at home for a month or so while he was sick. My grades took a turn, and the problems I faced prior to my grandfathers illness persisted. So once the semester was coming to a close, I decided to transfer to another school.

The school I chose was one I knew very well. It was about 30 minutes from my home, I spent a lot of time in the town the school was in, and I knew some people who went there from high school. It seemed at first the perfect school for me, there was a great music scene, which I appreciated because I had wanted to start a band for a long time. The area was gorgeous, and I was already familiar with the area. Once I got to this school I faced severe depression due to the isolation I felt in the beginning. I had left the social group I spent two years getting to know, and anyone who transfers can attest to how scary it is to leave what you had behind for something new. My grades suffered due to my depression, but I did well overall. However, one class that absolutely tanked my gpa was one I did all the work for, and had an A in the class until my professor dropped me down to a C over my final paper. There were no explanations, no corrections, and when asked to discuss it, they never responded. Spring Semester came around and I am by far at my lowest ever. More family issues arose, that took a lot of my time away from studies. I found a job to make ends meet with rent and necessities, but in order to make enough I had to work more than I should have. I contracted pneumonia about 2 weeks into the semester, and that took me away from class for about 3-4 weeks.

I don't want to make this a pity party for myself, I have some other issues that came about but are not worth mentioning due to the length of this post. I also fully acknowledge life is hard, and you either rise to the occasion or fall short when the pressure is too much. I am here to simply ask for some advice, the semester is about 3 weeks away from being over, and I can already say I will either fail one or two of my classes, and there's no ability to drop them. One professor offered to take some late assignments, but I don't think they will bring me to a passing grade. Another professor never responded to any of my emails over the semester, so I have completely given up on that class. I am at a very high chance of being on academic probation, and I have lost all confidence and hope in myself to bounce back. 

This is a lot, and I apologize in advance, but I don't know what to do. I can't drop out, I can't take a semester off, and I just don't know what to do. Anyone who has had similar experience in college, our made the comeback, how did you do it? Anyone who can provide insight, it is greatly appreciated. I know some of this sounds hard to believe, but I assure you this is as honest of a retelling as it possibly can be without becoming a whole biography.

812,t1_l095rq8,1713501919.0,"I am a teacher, so I may be able to give you some insight.

I want to start by saying that it sounds like you got hit with a lot in a very short period of time, and that is always very difficult. Anxiety and depression often follow major life changes like the ones you described, so I am not terribly surprised that you are experiencing those feelings right now. The hardest part is, when you start to lose, you lose momentum - and then things get worse - and then we start making prophecies of our own failure and inadvertently fulfill them.

With all that being said, take stock of where you are, not where you fear you are. 

***With the first professor, hand in the missing assignments with as high a quality as you can***. Even if you do not pass, it will be worth salvaging your grade to the best of your ability. As a teacher, I can tell you that I am far more likely to pass a student if they make the effort in the end than if they give up entirely.

***With the professor who is not responding to email, I would suggest figuring out what their office hours are and showing up in person.*** Don't mention the emails unless they ask something to the effect of ""why haven't you contacted me?"" Your main goal is to convey that you want to make the most of your remaining time in their class and learn as much as you can - that you are sorry that you missed as much content as you did. If they asked why you weren't there, give them the short version and take ownership of what you could have done - but don't beat yourself up. Even if they don't pass you, use this as a learning opportunity and make the most of the time you have left there.

Both of these things are difficult, but necessary. It will set you on the right foot for next semester - rather than getting into the cycle of running away - which is common for students who are in a tough spot. I was one of those students too.

I know your pain when it comes to finding yourself without your friend group, and changing to a campus where few, if any people know you. I also experienced problems with my major and my friend groups too. All of that sucks. I didn't have an abusive relationship, but my long time girlfriend dumped me just before I got into my last semester of my senior year. It sent me into a tailspin of depression. This was all a long time ago for me - but I haven't forgotten.

If I could have done it again, I would have focused on mastering myself first. When I stopped trying to worry and started trying to work, I noticed that I eventually outran the things that were plaguing me.

815,t1_l096rtp,1713502462.0,"Prof here.

Unfortunately, it's complicated and perpetuating series of historical happenings... I'm oversimplifying/generalizing here, and it's likely TLDR.

Going to college was once a sign of accomplishment/affluence. 

Almost all parents yearned for their kids to go to college to better themselves and land better jobs.

For a while it was basically guaranteed that going to college would get you paid more.

More people went to college. Higher Ed industry grew. You start to see more for-profit colleges with easier access and bigger promises. 

More colleges fighting for students to buy in. Standards lowered. Entry is easier. Finding money to go gets easier, but more devious.

Parents expect their kids to go to college as a normal occurrence. Many students feel they have to go. Higher Ed gets saturated and financially prosperous. 

Having a college degree isn't special in the workplace anymore. Harder for recent grads to stand out in a crowded job market. 

Big economic crash.

Recently graduated students start to realize that all that free money wasn't actually free. Crippling debt on top of economic downturn. 

Major life events postponed - buying a home, having kids...

The debt and impact on lives causes people to question the value of education.  Is it worth all the debt and despair?

Higher Ed industry sees the questioning and doubles down on making college easier to get into by further lowering standards both to get in and to stay in. 

For many educators, academic rigor is forcibly replaced by the ""customer is always right"" academia, fueled by bottom lines.

The value of higher ed is questioned even more due to even lower standards and further economic problems. 

Online education grows as a cheaper alternative to residential education. Many start to see this as the better choice. You start to see questionable value, online-only, take your money and run colleges pop up.

Value questioned even more.

Big problem incoming. In no small part due to economic downturn, people are having fewer children. This translates into fewer college-age students available. That cliff is coming. 

Colleges need to pivot to being even more accessible to start relevant and competitive in the saturated market. ""Everything's flexible and negotiable"" in higher education. We need to cater to our customer's needs and wants.

Pandemic hits. Shit gets real. It affects us horribly. All of us, students, staff, faculty... Life gets really hard for a lot of people.

Pandemic forcibly accelerates online education on colleges. Do or die. Academics now cater to the individual needs of each student. Ultimate flexibility and unrestricted ""understanding"" becomes the norm. 

We're all going through some stuff. Everyone - rightfully so - tries to take it easier on each other. Everyone gets an A because of the situation.

We got used to Netflix, DoorDash, Zoom... Never leaving the house but having everything on-demand. Consume. I bet I can be a content creator. Look it up on YouTube.  What do I even need college for?

We all physically come back from the time away, but some of us never truly come back. We like it easier. We still got graded/paid the same for doing less. I don't want to go to work. Can't I just...

Post-pandemic, the economy changed. Things are more expensive. 

But we still want it our way, immediately, and as cheaply as possible.

Higher Ed has a money problem. No one wants to pay sticker prices for college. More financial aid! Make entry simpler. Cater! Pander! Satisfy! Retain!

Education, served like Burger King: have it your way. Give them what they want when they want it. Do it all, now. Yesterday. Anticipate every individuals' needs. Give them everything you have, day and night.

But cut costs everywhere.  Resources dwindling. Incoming classes are smaller. Is the ship sinking? Faculty leaving for higher-paying jobs. 

Admin not replacing them to lower the budgets. Spread the work around to the rats left on the ship. Oh but there's no additional pay. No, we can't do raises this year. For the good of the cause!

Faculty: What am I doing?

Student: Why should I care? 

Staff: Please don't fire me. 

Parent: Why does my child have an F?

Administration: What can we do to pass this student?

And now here we are. Education is kinda fucked up. 

It's a product of us. We did this.

There are a lot of good, honest, passionate, hard-working people on every side of this - students, staff, faculty, admin. Great people that actively resist the generalizations I put forth here. 

But there's so many who have given in to bottom-line, basic, Burger King education.  For some, it's the only way they survive. For others, it's just easier.

I'm not sure how we figure this one out, if we do. Maybe it needs time. Maybe better economics. But here's where we are.",2024-04-19 00:54:22

Choosing a degree purely based off money or difficulty etc is going to come back to bite you. Find some majors that sit in between those two aforementioned questions and go from there. Your major and classes will be so much more enjoyable when it‚Äôs something you actually like or are good at. I recommend going to a community college for a year or two and then transferring to a 4 year. CC is much cheaper and you can get required classes (English, humanities, etc) out of the way and not have to do them at a 4 year. You‚Äôll then also have more time to experience college and figure out what you‚Äôd like to do. Colleges also have fairs for all sorts of fields so you can get a taste of what you think you‚Äôre interested in. Also, you won‚Äôt be wasting (much) money by changing majors. I changed mine my freshman year. If you stay in your field (ie engineering or business), most of your classes will transfer to your new major anyway. Even if you do end up having taken classes you didn‚Äôt need, it‚Äôs not the end of the world. If you‚Äôre paying with loans, you‚Äôll be in debt any way you do it. Basically, go to a community college for required classes and experience, transfer to a 4 year with a major in mind, try it out for a semester, and go from there.

830,t3_1c7pyey,1713508017.0,"I'm 21, I've been studying computer science and going to graduate end of this year. But I'm not your average comp sci student, i got into it due to my passion of creating products, but uni hasn't been liked this, focusing on theoretical coding/math which I'm extremely bad at (Ive always been like this). I've barely passed most of my courses through memorization, asking many questions, and spending lots of time through brute force. I haven't truely learnt or understood much. I don't know, I've just always been like this since school, I can put lots of time into things I'm passionate about, but not efficiently or with good coding standards.

As such, I'm not confident in my abilities so I'm not looking forward to getting my first job (I've been on the doll). I will have like 30k in HECs, and 25k in the bank by graduation, which I'm at a crossroads of putting into HISA or ETFs but that isn't the point of this post.

I also have had been amazed by stuff like chatgpt, I've kept up with all of the research and developments. It's been a light in the tunnel, but also a dark one, for someone like me who isn't smart. Dark in the sense that if I take a gap year, I'm almost sure ill come back to systems which are nearing the point of making me obsolete in the work force. It might not be there yet but its semantics at that point, it'll happen in the next year or two if it isn't.

However, it is also amazing because it can then help me to create all the ideas I have, and I could be some baby enterpreneur. I would LOVE if it worked out like this and i could finance it.

And I havent really gotten to travel. I've been told if I travel after graduating it'll be harder for me to find a job afterwards. This is concerning because I'm already not confident in finding a job. And my friends and family will keep asking me what I'm doing and I just hate that, I just want to be left alone. And I genuinely think I'll only get to work a couple of years before AI makes me pointless in the workforce. It sounds nice for me to travel for X months and come back to a different reality where i can see where my skills may be needed elsewhere. As for my travelling, I'm not sure where I'd go yet, but I'd love to backpack solo and travel on the cheapest of shoestrings. By working while I'm overseas (even though i've never worked before) and couch surfing, or pet sitting, or sleeping in a hamac, id hopefully limit costs so that I won't be taking $ out of the bank. also not sure how long i could go for but the more the merrier I say? I'll practice it in australia before before going overseas.

And most importantly, expectations of my future and my wants/needs:

I do not care to have a family, I do not care for a house, I'd much rather a hotel next to public transit in a walkable city. I don't have a car and I don't plan on getting one (I have my license but I just hate driving so I don't). I really hate the rat race of society which is likely why ive not worked a day in my life or done too well at uni. How I've been treated while on the doll has reaffirmed this, and mental health has declined just from this idea of how people treat you differently. It's actually made me want to work **less** because I'm really stubborn and if someone annoys or patronizes me I **hate** taking their advice. I would rather sacrifice my livelihood by living as cheaply as possible while still feeling secure by having access to necessities ie food/power/sleep then to constantly focus on money. For what? Just so I can afford to eat out, shop and buy junk or go on some extravagent travel? I'd rather cook something myself (even if I dont have many of the skills atm), only buy necessities that I really really need, or go on cheap travels and experience the country in a less touristy manner. As such, I do not really care if i get 200k, 100k or 50k as my annual income, I already don't spend money as is (Thats how ive got 20k in the bank without working. I do live with my parents though.). All I really want and value is time, so I can focus on other parts of my life.

Also, I have like 0 life skills but im willing to learn if i'm not patronized constantly, which is the main reason I haven't up until now. That's a big reason why I want to travel and work overseas or live with others.

844,t3_1c7rtof,1713515672.0,"I asked this on another thread but wanted to hear your opinions or similar experience like mine?

I am a pre-nursing student who am at week 12 out of 15 left in this semester. This week, I took a quiz for this online class and got a 0 out of 1 on a fill-in-the-blank question because the system detected a space bar I made after typing the answer. However, i got the term right.  Prior to this, I had a similar situation 7 weeks ago where I added a period at the end and was marked 1/2 off, but the term was correct. There are 2 instructors teaching the course and I didn‚Äôt it think through, so I just emailed one of them (instructor A) but I never got a response back. 
Where I messed up was, I forgot about it since I was just overloaded with assignments (i get 12-13 assignments weekly of other classes), work, etc. If anything, I assumed that she would reach back to me, but it never happened. 

Anyways, after seeing this error, it reminded me of the last quiz, so this time I emailed instructor B in case the other instructor may not reply again. I explained my situation and asked if both can be adjusted (I provided all screenshots) and she responds that I should have emailed her on the first quiz and instructor A on this week‚Äôs quiz because they‚Äôre in charge of certain modules. She adds that she will adjust this week‚Äôs for me, but the first ‚Äúwill not be addressed because it was 7 weeks ago‚Äù. 

I know where I messed up on my part. I was not attentive enough about making sure who to email because on each module, their names are provided on the side, and on the syllabus it briefly states that if we have any questions about a module, to email whoever is in charge. But at the same time, I feel this slight unfairness since Instructor A could have at least reached out and let me know, but she didn‚Äôt. I also feel that because my answers were literally correct, that this can be adjusted. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm asking to retake the quiz but informing that there was an error on the system. I understand that being on top of things is preparing me for nursing, but I feel that this is unnecessary and ridiculous that my correct answer cannot be graded because I was 7 weeks late asking the instructor who was in charge of that week now. 

I was going to confront about this respectfully, but decided not to since I didn‚Äôt want to overstep myself and give her the wrong impression of me wanting to stand my ground for a simple error and misunderstanding. 

Is this reasonable for me to feel this way? 
Has this happened to anyone? 


Edit: I wanted to clarify for those asking about the quiz being a small and minute point, this course is quiz-based and contributes 75% of the grade, so it makes a huge difference of my letter grade as it would have brought me from an 88% to a 90%.

So ADHD is TOUGH when you are a student. The dopamine deficiency in our brains makes it difficult to  stay focused and causes low motivation to the point of task paralysis. A fun fact is also the issues with our dopamine firing means our brains can't complete its reward circuit which means we literally discount time against rewards.

Anyway - I created a study tool for us. It is called **Kumo Study** on the chrome store (totally free to use).  


Basically the trick is to break down your study sessions into sets of work and rest (like if you were an athlete) and assign yourselves training sessions each day based on what you have due that week, what you have coming up and how you feel that day. You can't go hard out everyday or, like an athlete you will burn out.

So some ""sessions"" I do are:

&amp;#x200B;

* 3x 45mins work/7mins rest followed by 4x 52mins work/8mins rest and finish with 3x 15mins work/5mins rest  

* 4x 90mins work/17 mins rest followed by 8x 18mins work/7mins rest  

*  3x 48mins work/12mins rest followed by 3x 15mins work/5mins rest (on shorter days)

&amp;#x200B;

Don't be afraid of taking rests!

The tool also has a citation generator (so you can generate the citations when on the website, all saved back to your dashboard) a website blocker when you are feeling extra unmotivated and bookmarking tool/weekly task list tool.

1. At **some** universities, with permission from administration, you can be enrolled at two different institutions simultaneously. As long as you do not already have too many transfer courses, then you can transfer the courses you need in. Be careful. Many universities only permit a certain number of courses during a certain ""remaining number of hours"".
2. If it's the university's fault that you do not have the classes you need to graduate, because of their lack of staffing, you can ask for **class substitutions**. An advisor would pick other classes that you could take instead of the ones that are not available that they are willing to use **in your case**.
3. Sometimes an independent study can provide relief. For instance, a sympathetic Dean or Chair can ask faculty members to let you take these classes as ""independent studies"". There is still a syllabus. You still turn in the work and take the exams. But you're the only person in the class. You basically have weekly meetings with whoever is willing to work with you.

A good advisor or a good chair is an advocate. Universities don't like anything that extends the years on their graduation rates. It's not good for accreditation. But everything depends on the unique situation.

**Silver Lining:** You're young. I'm retired. No need to rush out into the world many of us couldn't wait to crawl out of...**although I loved my job**. LOL. You're in a magical time of life.

So in short, I'm in my last year of college and I have two more semesters left, which means I can finish college successfully in a little more than six months and the academic phase of my life will be behind me.
 I also promised myself an internship with a very good company, but that's only if I finish my studies on time and don't delay with them.
 The thing is that the last two semesters are actually the hardest in the degree and in addition I already feel worn out and find myself barely studying even though I'm so close to the end and not only that, like I said if I don't finish on time the internship opportunity will also slip through my fingers.
 I would appreciate tips on how I can get into a crazy mode of learning in the next six months and how I can really manage to have iron discipline at least for the next six months, because yes I have the motivation that I can already see the end.
 I would appreciate learning tips and anything that could help me.

unfortunately that means youll also be competing with a huge amount of business majors in the job market. We cant all be managers.

you can choose the more technical business majors which are newer. supply chain, and management information systems are personally my only recommendation for the business college. 

however if youre truly invested into the business college. id highly recommend working full time somewhere anywhere and investing your savings into making your own business. experience will always win over education. its difficult to hire someone as a manager when their only experience running a business is in a classroom being told what to do, instead of someone who has actually put their hands into managing. during my undergrad i worked as a landscaper and 3 of my coworkers were business major graduates who were applying for jobs all the time and getting nothing back. thats how saturated the business market is. i had a job offer before i graduated in chemical engineering.

Do you want to feel that your work is important, fulfilling, or meaningful? If so, in what way? 

How much do you enjoy working alone vs actively collaborating with coworkers on shared tasks? 

How well do you handle stress and managing your time to deliver things on a deadline? 

Can you see yourself managing other people? Or you'd prefer to be a kind of specialist? 

Are you a detail-oriented person, or do you enjoy bigger picture planning and strategy?

There is no scientific or medical evidence that abortion is dangerous or should be illegal. Period. You're just not going to find such a thing.

Its a little dated though so double check the sources. You could also start by just biology/embryology books. They will all vouch for the fact a zygote, embryo, and fetus is 100% an individual human being. Personhood is the debate, not the humanity aspect.

OP, feel free to PM me for more source ideas, this was just off the top of my head.

I am religious but NONE of my reasons for being pro life are religious. I also think no matter what women choose they deserve love and compassion, and having to choose abortion is one of the hardest thing a person has to make a decision for.

Oh also!! Check out Albany Rose on facebook. She only recently became christian, but for years she was 'atheist pro life' on facebook. She might have good sources linked for non religious sources.

I also know princeton has a lot of embryology research. 

David Daleiden also did an expose on planned parenthood selling aborted fetus parts and a quote I found really depressing was something along the lines of 'their humanity is not considered valid, yet its the same humanity that makes them valuable for research.'

1043,t1_l0cf135,1713555571.0,"Alr, I'm finishing up my first year, so I'll tell you everything that I actually use. Your dorm may have different rules on what you can bring, but I'm going off of mine.

Firstly, school supplies

- Some nice mechanical pencils and pens. I recommend some Pilot G-2s or similar. Get a nice metal mechanical pencil. I personally like nicer pens and pencils because I'm less likely to misplace them. 

- Notebooks, generally one per subject. I prefer all seperate, but if you like those 5 subject ones, get those.

- Post-it notes. I have so many on my wall it's unbelievable. They're good to just note something down and stick to your wall.

- A laptop. Find one that works for you. I recommend at least 8gb of RAM though. You're going to have lots of tabs open on occasion, and need something that can handle that. It's 2024, unless you get the absolute cheapest thing, it'll likely have 8gbs of RAM, make sure you check though.

- Someone said a binder, get that if you want, I personally prefer folders. However, I actually haven't had much of a need for one. I rarely ever get papers. YMMV, get a few just in case of what you prefer.

Secondly, dorm materials. I'm not going to touch on the large things, you discuss that with your roommates (i.e. 1 mini fridge or two? Who brings a microwave (are you allowed to have one in your dorm?) etc etc). I'm just going to list small things you might skim over. Things I wish I made sure to bring when I first came here

- Snacks. Snacks snacks snacks snacks. I genuinely thought I didn't need any because I'm not a snackish person. My god was I wrong. Get yourself some chips, granola bars, anything. There'll be nights you're up late, the dining hall is closed, you don't have enough money to go buy mcdonalds. You'll want something you can eat in your dorm. Even if it's just to ward off hunger enough to sleep and get breakfast in the morning.

- Soda/La Croix/Whatever else you drink. Again, there'll be times you just genuinely want some. 

- Some form of scent. You likely can't have candles, maybe not even wax melts. But get something that gives off a pleasant scent. Coordinate with your roommate on a good one for both of you. You're going to have dirty clothes in your dorm, plus possibly two teenagers, all in a very tight space. If you don't take precautions, it's going to smell. On a similar note, open your windows every so often.

- Band-aids + other basic first aid stuff, tylenol, advil, ibuprofen, whatever you normally take. I've cut myself just enough to justify having a large box of bandaids. And i've gotten so many headaches that ibuprofen is a must.

- Broom (if you have hard floors). I personally don't have one because I didn't think to bring one. You're going to be tracking in a lot of dirt. You'll definitely want one.

- Extra blankets. My god, the amount of nights I've had to wear a sweater to bed cause my school fucked with the radiators and made them stop working. 

I can't really think of much else. Other than a general recommendation for packing for a dorm. Don't. Over. Pack. You'll think you've packed just enough, but you'll likely have too much. Honestly, don't go so overboard, but it's ok if freshman year you overpack a bit. It'll suck trying to find all that space, but you'll learn how much space dorms have, and you'll be able to pack much smarter next year.",2024-04-19 15:39:31
1044,t3_1c85uzc,1713555608.0,"Hi! I posted something similar a few months back in a different subreddit, so apologies if you've already seen this post. Anyways, I am majoring in Environmental Science and need to pick a specialization/emphasis for the major. I have gone through the options and am stuck between environmental policy or environmental biology. If each of these had the same amount and weight of pros and cons, I would choose biology, but there is one huge factor that is causing me to be nervous of choosing biology.

First, for environmental policy, I find policy research interesting, especially when it comes to the environment and conservation, and can see myself enjoying working in that field, and also the coursework that would get me there. However, I fear that the lack of lab-based courses would make me bored and less passionate.

For biology, I am so passionate about it, especially ecological biology. However, specializing in biology means I will have to take two more quarters of chemistry. I am terrible at chemistry and it will have been almost 2 years since i took first quarter general chemistry (and I barely passed that one), so I do not have as much information retained as other students will, since they will be going into second quarter chemistry with only a few weeks gap. I fear that specializing in biology will cause my GPA to drop because of chemistry, and since it has been so long since taking the first quarter of general chemistry, I might even fail second or third quarter chemistry. Other than the chemistry aspect, there aren't many more negative aspects to this major for me. I really am passionate about biology, but I do not know if it is practical for me. Because of this I don't know what to do. Any tips, advice, etc will help!

TLDR; I want to specialize in environmental biology, but am worried that a 2 year gap between general chemistry 1 and general chemistry 2 will cause me to fail my final two quarters of chemistry that I have to take, causing me to retake them, stay longer at my university, and my GPA to drop. Additionally, I barely passed that first quarter of chemistry so because of the gap years, not much of that information I learned has been retained. ",2024-04-19 15:40:08

I know it feels hopeless, but try this method. Build the presentation first, then fill in your essay to match it. 

And most importantly, remember your thesis is YOUR journey through research, not the story of the research you were a part of. You are describing all of the things you directly did for your thesis and how they individually advanced your hypothesis. 

Do you feel that you were on too many projects to pick one clear thesis? That‚Äôs fine, pick a larger topic and break it down into about 3 goals. The thesis itself is pretty flexible in terms of format, so you can craft it however you want, as long as it follows the overall guidelines. 

I know these examples may not apply to you exactly, but my dms are open if you want more specific advice.

MOST importantly, remember your mental health is vastly more important than any research you could do. take breaks, spread out the writing, and dont be too hard on yourself. it sounds like your advisor is awful for making you feel bad, but really, any lack of thesis material THEIR fault for misguiding you. obviously you cant point that out to people though. if you are closer with other members of your thesis committee, you can also ask their advice before the defense. 

finally, remember, this isnt grades, its pass/fail. converting that to letter grades means even a C passes. your only goal is to finish the essay and tell the story of all of the things you've done. Literally make a list if all the projects youve worked on and pick one figure/chart/picture from google that you can use to show your contribution. then go through and see if those pictures tell the whole story. if not, add more to each slide. if you run out if content, then go to your advisor.",2024-04-19 17:19:22

For starters, I am from the south and I am transferring to a college in my hometown, so a storage unit here is not the solution. 

Also, I am self reliant for this move out and renting a U-Haul is just not happening. Also, last August my parents and I did a 2 day drive to get here, but that is not going to be possible for the move out. 
I am going to be flying home in May with a carry on and a checked bag so I will definitely be able to put my essentials in those. 

I have looked up online and am seeing that shipping five 16x16x12 boxes thru UPS/Fedex will end up costing around 400$ for ground shipping. 

I have done some online searching, but there isn‚Äôt really much of a clear guide here so im wondering if anyone has some first hand experience.

I want to be able to play tennis and run cross country at college, but I won't be good enough to be the best of the best and participate in the main college team. However, I have always (and still do) loved playing sports competitively against other schools in high school. The excitement of challenging a new opponent, the great memories I've made with my teammates, and the thrill of doing better than I ever have before are all things I just don't want to say goodbye to just yet. I could run and practice tennis with a couple of friends at college, although it wouldn't be the same.

Do colleges of this size usually have some sort of club where you can play competitive sports against other schools but not need to be crazy good? If so, what's it like, and how good do you generally have to be to join? I haven't taken a look at my college's list of clubs yet, but there's supposedly about 1,000 (including crazy stuff like a lactose intolerant club) which would make looking for what I want a little difficult. If there's not a way to continue being competitive in sports through college, what ways have you guys been able to continue your sports outside of school?

For context, my 5K time in CC was 19:43 (I ran a 19:38 earlier today, although that won't make much of a difference). I know that in college they run 10Ks for Cross Country, and my fastest 10K was just shy of 45 minutes (but I ran that last year and could probably run sub 44 or sub 43 in another week if I tried).

Like business school is not easy, I have a ton of projects, papers, and case studies that I am doing all the time. It‚Äôs a different kind of hard, comparing it to engineering where it‚Äôs a lot of math and complex concepts you have to learn. Where in business you are just studying a completely different kind of knowledge with studying about companies and what actions do what and studying how companies can improve in different areas. Engineering students often say the business school is easy because very little and relatively simple math is done but they also haven‚Äôt studied the complex issue of global ethics and politics, what marketing strategies are good for what demographics, how the economy responds to certain legislation decisions, etc. They are just different. Also the statistics department (in the school of physical sciences) did a study and found that business students at the university I go to had the second highest workload just behind nursing students.

Also where I go to school there is a huge push for getting students to be good at managing time, setting goals, and being productive with their day. This gives the appearance of business school being easy as a lot of us business students, due to this push, are more likely to be better at time management than our academic counterparts so we can usually go hangout and easier to have a social life. Also huge push for networking and getting to know people in the business school and I had a class where I had to report on my networking activities every week. This sounds great as many will say you get credit for being social but at the same time when I have a busy week I have to be on top of it so that I can make time to have networking opportunities throughout the week. Unlike my engineering friends who when they had a busy week could just focus on their schoolwork. This networking assignment tbh isn‚Äôt a big deal but it is something to bring up.

But that‚Äôs my observation and hope that helps. tbh most of the time, at least at my university, we just don‚Äôt care enough when people say business school is easy. We are just trying to survive and get a degree like everyone else.",2024-04-19 19:37:07

- Good grades. You‚Äôll want at LEAST a 3.5 to be competitive for most programs. 

- Patient care experience. Work as a CNA, EMT, home health aid, etc. Get experience being around patients. 

- Shadowing. You need to shadow doctors to make sure this career is really for you first. You‚Äôll also need shadowing hours to apply. 

- Extracurriculars. Join an intramural sports team, the microbiology club, a disability awareness group, your pre-med chapter at your college, etc. Get involved on campus. 

- Volunteering. Get out in your community. Look for local RAM clinics, volunteer within schools, etc. This looks great on applications. 

- Research. You‚Äôll want to look into research opportunities on campus. This may not be necessary, but it‚Äôs a huge advantage if you can do some undergrad research with a microbio or anatomy professor.

I was in a frat the last two years of my undergrad and I loved my frat brothers and the partying scene. However, as soon as I started my fifth year/last year of school, that desire of partying or going to bars on the weekend completely vanished. The idea of going out every weekend and spending up to 50 dollars in drinks a night became absolutely insane to me. I suddenly valued a good night of sleep and some relaxing self care routines over getting wasted and having a ""good"" time. I started to drift away from some of the brothers in my frat and overtime, I came to see how some of the people I used to roll with aren't exactly role models or people I want to share similar traits with.

As someone with ADHD, but unmedicated (I like to live dangerously, lol) this is what I find useful:

1. Majoring in something I am interested in. I find the classes I am interested in I focus more and I am more motivated to do the work and do well. Place me in a Medieval Studies class I can focus on that shit all semester long. Put me in an English Lit course and I will bust my ass, but I won't be as focused or motivated. If you want me to die a horrible and painful mental death... put me in a Math class.

2. Study groups. I find that it is easier and more motivating to study in a group. That way there is more motivation to study and less motivation to check your phone and go on 'little' breaks. My classmates act as if I am doing them a huge favour by organizing study groups for tests, but in reality... those groups help me.

3. Routine. Get into a routine that is doable and stick to it. I found having a routine where doing certain things before doing coursework made getting into the coursework easier. I hope that makes sense. The disadvantage to this is you will feel soo lost when the semester is over and you won't know what to do with yourself.

4. Becoming familiar with the profs. I am not talking about making friends with them, but make sure they know who you are. I find that if the prof knows me then there is more motivation to do better because I do not want them to think ill of me. It is strange, but it works.

5. Susing out profs who are flexible with deadlines. I always email a prof before I register for a course to see who is more willing to extend deadlines and who has deadlines set in stone. Having a prof who is willing to extend a deadline makes all the difference when you get a random hyperfixation or have a period where your focus is just not there.

6. Take a reduced course load. I have never taken more than 3 and that is what my brain can handle. If you have an official diagnosis for ADHD you should be able to get accommodations where a full course load for you would be 3 instead of 4. You might be able to get other accommodations as well; it is worth talking to the disability center at your school.

7. Alarms. Alarms on when to start studying. Alarms for classes. Alarms for everything. And back up alarms as well.

8. NEVER STUDY AT HOME! I have my places to study and none of them are at home. Home is full of distractions. 'I need to write that paper, but before we do that lets clean up that doom pile that has been there for the past several months'. I study on the quiet floor of my university's library or I use my noise cancelling headphones and study at the McDonald's down the road from me. Never. Never at home.",2024-04-19 23:59:27

the stereotype comes from the fact that commonly a lot of rich white kids study it just to have a degree for their parents or for them to spend some time in college. Literally one example is an uncle of mine (we aren‚Äôt white but whatever) he has a rich dad and studied business management. the dullest most easiest major ever. You don‚Äôt learn anything of substance. He then went on a backpacking spree after college, another thing u see rich kids doing. So these people make others look like we are in it for some easy classes but some of us need well paying careers and choose majors within the school that help you get that.

I had dropped out of my first attempt at college and went to work in the service industry in the New Orleans French Quarter. Nothing to do BUT 24 hour bars and that's how people socialized.

""They"" say it's THE thing to do where all the socialization happens and the cute girls go, but it really is over hyped.

But I think some time around my late 20s, it lost it's luster. Gradually tapered off going until I don't think I have set foot in a bar in years.

My reasons?

* It's expensive even if you are only drinking PBR and cheap draft.
* I never really made friends in there.
* I did manage to ""pick up"" or ""get picked up"" and did have a one night stand or three over the YEARS I went, but it was rare and unfulfilling. The better relationships were from online or through social/work networks. And nowadays, people frown on that because both of y'all are too drunk and there's been some embarrassing moments and waking up next to crazy.
* Most bars are loud as hell and no meaningful conversations were ever had.
* Got tired of felling like shit if I accidentally over drank.
* Being too drunk out and about late at night (or anytime really or any place other than the house) is a legal and safety risk.
* While there are older people bars, past 30, this shit is just sad. Jumps the shark probably by mid 20s and only marginally worthwhile younger than that.",2024-04-20 02:35:30

I started university at the age of 18 but a personal situation happened where I got kicked out of the university and I losed all motivation to return to college. I was going to be a student athlete at the time. Then, upon returning to college in the spring at a community college I had more problems dealing with mental health. 

As a teenager in high school I dealt with a lot of bad people which made my mental health worse. Fast forward, in 2019 it is affecting my college days by me completely flunking out in cc. Mind you, I still have that first university‚Äôs debt to think about while attending school and during high school I had serious trouble attending class due to bullies. 

Then, more down the road I attended a local community college instead of one to be a student athlete. And, things seemed to be better, I started getting credits towards an AA degree, not C‚Äôs either‚Äî all As. I never really had a problem attending class except one semester where the workload seemed impossible for me so I had to withdraw. As semesters gone by, and me getting used to the community college environment, I did really well while attending there. Took me three years to get the AA degree, and got A‚Äôs in all my classes, except math, passed with a C. 

What I am trying to get at though compared to the normal undergraduate college student I would be over age (23m). While most students graduate on time at the age of 22 with a bachelors. I feel so down because of this and feel like a failure almost every day. I notice students start master‚Äôs programs later in life not right after their bachelors. So that alone is keeping me from feeling really really bad about myself. üòï

I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to share a bit about where I am in life right now and ask for some encouragement as I consider taking a big step forward.

I completed a two-year degree in culinary arts and a four-year bachelor's in entrepreneurship. Currently, I'm running my own business that brings in a gross income of $26,000 USD per month. While I've found success in entrepreneurship, I can't shake the feeling that there's more out there for me.

I've been contemplating the idea of ""studying again,"" and honestly, it's a bit daunting. But when I think about the reasons for studying abroad, it ignites a fire in me. I crave new opportunities, I want to change my life, and I'm hungry for personal growth and purpose. Bringing my parents to abroad, being independent, and becoming a global citizen are just some of the dreams driving me forward. Plus, the idea of learning more about myself, experiencing a better climate, and having more career opportunities abroad is incredibly enticing.

Yet, despite these aspirations, I find myself needing a bit of encouragement. Stepping out of my comfort zone and into the unknown is scary, but I believe it's the right path for me. So, if anyone has been through a similar journey or has some words of wisdom to share, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you all for your support and encouragement.",2024-04-20 10:13:44

I have completed all but 3 classes for my major, 1 of those being capstone, which I plan to take Fall of my senior year. I have been exploring the idea of a sociology minor for the past few months and have researched it and felt that it will be a good addition to my Psychology major since it revolves around the study of people and behavior in society. I was also going to do a second minor in social psychology because it would only take a few classes but decided against it due to it falling under the sociology category and that felt redundant when I could gain knowledge in something else that could benefit me. I recently learned about the public health minor and became interested in that as I am interested in the clinical field of psychology, specifically Geropsychology (The Psychology of Aging). I switched out one of the sociology electives I planned to take next semester and replaced it with Introduction to Public Health to see if it is something I would be interested in. If I don't end up liking it, it won't really delay me from graduating because I still have 2-3 empty slots to fill up anyway to meet my credit requirements. I was wondering if anyone has any personal experience or more in-depth knowledge of this combination of fields. I know they all can complement each other, I just wanted a more insightful and knowledgeable viewpoint.

You need to get a positive outlook, and stop dwelling on negativism and defeatist hyperbole.  To paraphrase Lloyd Blankfein, you're going to college, not to Omaha Beach in a Higgins boat.  

Keep in mind that you can control your own thoughts and reactions.  That may seem difficult at first, but with work it can be done.  Take positive steps to be the person you want to be, and work to reject internally-produced fear and doubt.  Physically, make sure you are on the best ADHD treatment for yourself.  

As far as advice goes, make sure you are seeking solutions.  Many people post such messages when they are in fact not looking for real help.  Instead, they seek sympathy and reinforcement from others with similar problems.  Be careful not to fall into that trap.",2024-04-20 15:11:18

I think im gonna fail this class because of them.

What do i do?

&gt; I have tried comunicating this to the teacher, he cant do anything or doesent give a shit.

&gt; I have tried talking to them irl, and trough group but they dont care and are clearly in the ""not giving a shit camp""

&gt; If i get angry or snap at them any chance of them doing the work is over, because people dont like having their shitty behaviour called out to them and they react negatively, so if i snap out or become too pushy, im certain they will cut me of the group, so now my only option is to hope they snap out of it and actually get work done.

&gt; Due to the nature of the assigment, it's literally impossible to do it alone.

I also want to live in the city, so I‚Äôm leaning more towards the Chicago schools than The U. If anyone has any info on any of these schools that would be great!

If I still want to graduate by may 2025, that means I will be taking 4 classes in fall of 2024. The reason why this is more doable than just taking another course over the coming summer is I have qualified for a really good scholarship starting in the fall that will cover most of my tuition.

&gt;Should I be trying to have fun while I'm still young?

Personally, I think the main problem here is that your perception of fun is having sex, getting drunk, and dating girls.

As some other commenters have said, you can still have fun and be social without jeopardizing your academics. Join clubs. Apply for student government. Get a job on-campus. Get an internship.

I'm about to finish my first year at college and it was phenomenal. I have never had a sip of alcohol, nor do I ever want to. Nothing about alcohol, drugs, sex, or anything else in that realm seems fun to me, although I understand people are interested in different things.

Point is, I've done none of those things so far and I've still managed to have an amazing experience. I joined a leadership group where I actively volunteered around campus. I became president of the history club and got accepted into Phi Alpha Theta, the national history honor society. I got an on-campus job as a peer advisor and recently got an additional on-campus job as an orientation leader for the summer.

I [M20] have had a crush on one of my students for a long time. I am an undergraduate TA, teaching other undergraduates. All of my students are first years and I am a third year. I have a crush on one of my students [F18 or F19]. I suspect she might have a crush on me. She just really reminds me of my past self in some ways - she is in the same major and program I started college in. She is also very hardworking and cares a lot about the class, like I did when I took it. She is very pretty but also very down to earth.
I‚Äôm kinda speculating here I guess like she may not be in to me at all but she asks me a lot of questions in the lab and by email, far more than any other student I have.
Sometimes it seems like she is just asking these questions to make conversation other times she actually kind of does need help with stuff.
 
When I first got an email from her asking some like marginally frivolous clarifying question it was late and I was like ‚Äúwhy is she emailing me at this time‚Äù so I investigated on ig and lo and behold she is from the same county as me and went to the high school next to mine so I thought like ‚Äúwow I have even more in common with her‚Äù and her academic attitude made more sense I guess.

I only have 3 clues she might be into me.
1. Lots of emails asking me for help with stuff (many after 11 pm)
2. One time she like broke formality and ended an email with a nickname not her name (probably should think nothing of it)
3. There was one time and there may have been others where she asked me a question and was like noticeably up in my personal space like I am sort of a close talker myself but she really came in close to ask this question.
Also I feel like I‚Äôm a fairly attractive person not model hot or anything but It wouldn‚Äôt be outside the realm of possibility that she likes me might just be grasping at strings though.

Also what do I do? The semester is sort of winding down. I‚Äôm not dumb enough to hit her up before final marks are due. But after do I say something to her? Give her my number? Try to be platonic? Follow her on social media? Like I would be kicking myself forever if I didn‚Äôt try to at least stay in touch and be friendly. I don‚Äôt want to be weird about it though?

If it makes you feel any better (it won't), you have AI on your radar right now, but there are lots of other things that can make jobs obsolete and you simply cannot know the future. I do not mean to be condescending in any sense, however my guess is you are young and haven't really been in the workforce and you simply have no idea about how adult life is. Now you are fixated on AI because its a tangible fear you can grasp abd understand right now. All of your feara about life are kinda getting put onto AI. AI isn't the problem...your big scary unknown future is the problem.

What you should plan on is having skills and getting your first job. From there you just stumble on. Data analysis and being able to use applications effectively is still very important and valuable.


You are waay waaay more likely to lose a job due to C levels being greedy, acqusitions and mergers, or offshoring than you are to lose it to AI in any job (other than writing and artists who are getting wrecked by AI now).

 Accountants and finance people aren't being replaced by AI (i know many). People still value human brainpower in many places. Yes this could change and probably is changing right now somewhat but you literally cannot do anything about that. Everything about the way society works could change. I'm sorry if i am giving you an existential crisis, but life is kinda like that. You just keep on going and adapt. You will NOT graduate with something that is ""100%"" useless.

Most people do not work in the field of their major. Most people, you ask them,will tell you they have no idea how they made it ""this far"" in life. You think they are just being humble? As a 42 year old, nope. This is the truth. You just wake up, make small decisions daily and bam you ""end up"" with some wildly different life than you thought you would.

Life has a way of just throwing you for loops despite your plans. 

For all you know you'll end up working in AI in the future. 

Don't worry about AI. Worry about the randomness of life.

Check my weird path out:  undergrad: photography and poliical science. Grad: creative writing in fiction. Current job: owner of a toy store. Previois job: video game designer. Not to mention how i ended up getting married and living where i do now. I couldn't have predicted or imagined any of it. 

Take the opportunities you get. Breathe. We are all in a fog of war stumbling through. All of us. Even the ones who look like they got their shit together run into situations they are not prepared for or knowledegable about.

Being an adult is knowing you don't know everything, can't control everything and are willing to ask for help and advice when you are in the dark. This is why mechanics, accountants, lawyers, finance people, and market analysis folks are valuable. They are the ones the rest of us go to when we are in the dark and need help. This is why they are valuable. I would absolutely lose my shit if any of them somehow switched to AI. Maybe they will in the future but I am certainly not living my life with that contingency in the forefront of my mind or letting it affect my daily life.

Artists and writers of all kinds, i think, are the ones genuinely getting decimated by AI at this moment and it is a real problem for them

Far too much variance to say exactly what GPA is ideal or what minimum GPA you should maintain, but in general, most grad programs have a 3.0 - 3.3 GPA minimum (but to be competitive the baseline is often much higher). In a *very generalized sense,* I'd say a competitive GPA for 95% of grad programs is probably \~3.7 - 3.8.

You should also consider that different programs will have different standards for calculating their GPA requirements, some will only consider cumulative GPA, others will only consider last two years of credit hours, others will choose which ever is highest, etc. And it's also important to note that GPA isn't the only requirement for grad school  and it's probably not even the most important, you can always bolster a lower GPA with research experience, publications, good letter of recommendations, and if you can find an advisor that you fit well with (this is probably the most important part about grad school apps, if you can convince/find a prof that *wants* to tak you on, little else matters as long as you meet the minimum requirements).",2024-04-21 11:58:54

Background: I am currently in my last year at University taking up Accounting with a concentration in Data Analytics. For the last 3 years of my university my internship varied from being a data analyst, finance intern and accounting intern. As I approach my last year I started developing genuine interest in real estate and what really got me hook was just honestly hearing some of my friends talk about how deals are so complex, how there are so much things you need to account for when you start a project and more. I know it seems pretty shallow but just knowing how there are so many things to learn in real estate genuinely piqued my interest. I have started watching a lot of video on the fundamentals of real estate truthfully I would say my understanding level is a COMPLETE beginner but I have been watching and trying to understand more about it!

So now, I have a final interview coming up for the Finance and Acquisition Analyst role and I am genuinely terrified because I do not have any experiences with real estate, I havent taken any offcial classes in RE. All the knowledge I have are from youtube/linked videos. One of the last questions I asked the recruiting manager was how do I standout in the interview and she said something that worried me which was most of my internships are just related to accounting. 

So my big question is how do I differentiate myself from other applicants when I do not have any real estate background?

thank you for reading sorry if it was a tough one.

I have adhd so I‚Äôm naturally disorganized, but I have to keep an in depth task management system for my life or everything falls apart, and online classes during quarantine are really what taught me those skills, and I still use the same system 3 years into college.

We are in the finals week of class, and everyone had to give a presentation. The professor harped on how we had to be respectful of everyone's presentation, (ie no talking, coming in late or leaving in the middle of class.) During the second day of presentations while a girl was presenting, I accidently knocked my plastic pencil case off my desk, spilling my pencils everywhere. I apologized, and quietly cleaned up my mess. Everyone, including the professor stared at me, and it was mortifying for my socially awkward self. After words, I silently slipped out of the room and had a 5 min breather in the bathroom to cool down after embarrassing myself. I forgot about it till today, where my teacher sent me an email saying I would have points marked off the assignment and my overall participation grade for the disruption. I think this is not fair at all, given that it was a complete accident, I apologized, and did nothing else. I have perfect attendance in the class, and always contribute to discussions and lectures.

Some classes like College algebra, English composition, Ethics, Philosophy science course, communications, and History are a great place to start. Most of those courses may be transferable toward a degree. 

Also, joining a junior college will allow you to meet with a counselor for guidance, some academic direction, without breaking the bank. Tuition for in state resident students are very low and it is a great education. I recommend you to have fun taking courses that you are interested in. 

Lastly,  I suggest checking https://www.onetonline.org a resource created by the US Labor Statistics.

Plus, my GPA last term was really great. 3.94 overall and 4.0 in my psych classes. I have lots of experience in the mental health field and love what I‚Äôm doing. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if I end up changing my mind, is it possible for me to do a masters in public policy or MPH if I wanted to? 

I‚Äôm not sure if I really want to double major as it might not really be worth the extra time and money. My school does have a mental health policy minor though, so I‚Äôm thinking about pursuing that instead! 

I know that I‚Äôm already halfway through my degree, but I‚Äôd rather have doubts and ask questions now rather than later. 

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated! Thank you!! ",2024-04-21 17:28:06

I'm a college **freshman** at a **CUNY school** (it's the one that mostly consists of finance majors, iykyk).

First let me start off with this: **I was accepted into NYU and Fordham but could not afford it.** I went to boarding high school (with a hefty scholarship) where several of my close friends went to private institutions costing $50k+. Since we were all super close, I allowed myself to believe I was ""one of them"" and also applied to these school with huge tuitions, not knowing I couldn't afford them. I also live with my high school sweetheart who goes to one of these ""expensive"" schools &amp; has their own place, so I'm getting a huge chunk off of my tuition already. Anyways, **ninth grade me though I was gonna be at Harvard or Columbia,** and now I'm having a hard time ""coping"" with failing to achieve my biggest goals as a teen. It almost feels like I'm losing hope in myself. ***How did y'all cope?***

ALSO!!!! **I'm a finance major** **but seriously don't know ANYTHING about finance.** Like, not even a *Rich Dad Poor Dad* level of understanding, however, I like to believe that I can change that. How can I ""catch up"" in order to make the most out of my time in this finance school? ***Finance majors: where did you start?*** Do you have anything that really helped y'all progress in the finance world? Whether it's Harvard lectures, finance books for dummies, news subscriptions, or something like volunteering, I'm willing to learn as much as I can about finance in order to get ahead.",2024-04-21 17:34:53

I was always a straight-A student, loved history and politics. There was never any doubt about what I wanted to study and even though I hadn‚Äôt really picked a job, I knew I was studying what I was passionate about. 

I completed my BA from one of Canada‚Äôs top Universities with Honours, and went on to complete a Master‚Äôs in Political Science, also with Honours, at the second top ranked school in Canada. 

But that was the end. I was motivated, always had been. But then reality set in. I had studied a subject that got me nowhere. I was educated, capable of research, able to write. I was so confident in my abilities, but I had nothing to show for it in the workforce. 

I bounced around retail jobs for a while, always staying on top of my resume and applying for entry level analyst jobs and internships. Yet I never got anywhere. I eventually settled into car sales, which is where I am now. I‚Äôm almost 30, and carry close to $70k in student debt. The money I make is okay, but I never saw myself here. I look at my colleagues, people who have been in the industry since they were 18, and they‚Äôre masters of their craft.

If I had just not gone to university and threw myself into work, I feel as though I would be so much further ahead in life. Maybe I could have afforded a home by now, who knows. 

I‚Äôve all but given up on ever using my degrees for anything. I‚Äôve accepted it was the biggest mistake of my life, a mistake I‚Äôll be financially making up for for the foreseeable future.

Dating 1.5M . I'm 19 F and 19 M. I really like my boyfriend however I can feel awkward and worry alot as I can get a horrible stomach ache which leaves me with acid reflux and feeling drained for no reason. It's either anxiety, sign we aren't for eachother or something else like danger. I need advice. I'd like to continue seeing him and seeing if it goes away and I love him or if it gets worst and I feel so sick constantly. I don't want to lead him in to Ive told him many times about this. This is my first relationship. I'm just looking for comfort and ease in relationship however I can feel so sick I might throw up. He's a super lovely guy and we click in many things however I think my brain obsessed over bad things like at dinner we get tired and drained and so he goes in his phone for a bit. I thought like shit that rude and I worried and spiraled into this isn't normal. We should have so much to talk about. Another thing is he is more spontaneous than me and better looking. He cheeky and makes sex noises in public and wants to chat up random people in street. I find this very embarrassing and don't like it. I tell him in jokey way but don't want to change him but I'll obsess over this as I'll think we aren't compatible. I'm too boring and he's too immature. He's had a long term relationship before too so he has more experience than he.i feel drained with his sometimes after couple hours or days straight together and I worry that's not normal as his my partner. Also I see men of s similar age and I'll think like oh he is cute and I worry like shit that's bad if me to think that. I wouldn't want to have relationship or anything but find them cute. Is this bad sign? 
He makes me feel good tho and when we hold hands or kiss I feel this lovely, buzzing Holden energy.
However I'll then think that's just because I've never done this before and I worry I'll never fall in love with him as I overthink everything and don't get attached to people much. 
Also what do you do in relationship. What's good deep questions to ask.
Can I get advice on what to do? How should I deal with my doubts and obsessing over differences? I think I have stomach ulcers too. I get scared incase down the line I don't like him but I'm trapped and that feels horrible. 
Basically I like him(don't live him yet atleast) and worry as this is first relationship so have low hopes. I'm new to all romantic things and get scared of everything it entails. 
Thank you",2024-04-21 19:31:04

Unfortunately, I did not get into the Big 10 university in my state and that's been my dream school since I was a kid. I decided to go touring a few different schools and the larger ones were what really caught my attention. Those are also the most expensive schools as they all would cost basically 200,000 dollars. I've toured a few smaller schools and some of them were nice and a lot more affordable, but I've just been very bummed because that just wasn't what I've been dreaming about since I was a kid.

I don't know if anyone has ever been in this situation but id appreciate any advice anyone has. My options are basically, take on an enormous amount of debt and go to a big school for 4 years, go to a CC and transfer but have to be stuck with family for another 2 years, or go to a smaller school for 4 years knowing that its not going to be what I've been thinking about since i was a kid.

I don‚Äôt have a job, I‚Äôve made a few grand pressure washing and am working a lot on an e-commerce business, so I don‚Äôt have a ton of money right now. My family is dirt poor so I have a financial aid score of -1500 (the best you can get) but financial aid packages ironically come out after the confirmation of attendance deadline so I have to go in completely blind. I got accepted into both for electrical engineering but honestly I am so tired and burnt out of using my brain for theoretical problems. I would be more inclined to attend for something like robotics where things are hands-on, but for electrical engineering it's really just going to be a bunch of math and theory. My dad is urging me to go to a UC because of the experience and the people I'll meet- he thinks I'll have fun. If I go to my local community college I would stay at home with him, and a lot of me feels bad- I feel like I'm leeching off my parents. My end goal in life is to make enough money to retire my parents, because with how much they make they will likely never be able to retire. A few years ago or even one year ago I was some kid with big dreams to change the world of science- I know so much about physics, quantum mechanics, electricity and magnetism- but honestly my only dreams now are to help people and to explore what the world has to offer. I feel like I can definitely make my business ventures work, but I need more time. I can't do it before I go to college. Going to community college would give me the opportunity to keep working on business and hopefully build a foundation for me. However, I feel like I'd be missing out on a lot of fun and a lot of knowledge (especially knowledgeable people I could work with on business) if I don't go to a UC.

While talking, we talked about relationships and I found out that he was bi and I told him that I was gay. However, I told him that I'm in a relationship. He was happy for me and congratulated me. After meeting up with him, I got his Snap and started a streak. Ever since then, I talked to him about meeting up again, he agreed. The only issue I'd that he doesn't put in effort for making plans since he claims that he ""is really bad at making plans."" I did not really care since I usually make plans with friends regardless. Within the last few weeks, I've brought up hanging out and getting food or something, but he seems to be busy. 
Likewise with making plans, I usually engage the conversations on Snap. We both are majoring in different things, so we never cross paths on campus. With that said, talking to him in person has not been achieved. While texting, he always gives me short responses. 
Overall Im debating if I should just drop making plans with him and keep him as a streak buddy, or if I should keep on trying.

 I was behind the supposed schedule of works. I pass the bare minimum assessments because I can't seem to find the right concept and design. Although I survived until our midterm Revalida with my floor plans, concepts, and site development plan, my consultant suggested to change my site with practical reasons which I see but it was so sudden. It was already half of the semester, I was barely keeping track with my works before midterms but the sudden site change fazed me and got me off the sched AGAIN. But I did find a new site after day(s) and did site analysis and revised some parts of my manuscript. And during holy week, I was thinking of the development plan and revising my floor plans (and this week we were supposed to be making a 3d model of our plans already). After the break I started modelling my design slowly but surely since my Revit, Sketchup, and Enscape expired I had to find an alternative urgently. Since I was restarting, I used Revit to revise the plan as I go. 

As the weeks pass, there was no day that I had 6hrs of sleep nor did I miss a day without working on my thesis. But must I say, I am very disappointed with my work because I know that I can do better. And I did hope that I could finish my work on time.

I moved to a different town, had two roommates that I got along with well, and started going back to school.

They would play their music as loud as they could at all hours of the night, to the point that I had to sleep in my closet just to not hear them. They would wake up early just to repeatedly slam the door and then go back to bed. They did EVERYTHING they could to get under my skin - and it worked. I moved out and life instantly got better.

I started living by myself in a small apartment and it was going well at first. Eventually, I started skipping class a lot more, barely ever turning in my assignments, drinking more, and sleeping all day every day. I don't have any motivation to do better.

I will try and break this down. 
You can apply online very easily, go on their website and fill out and online application for x college. Typically they will not ask much regarding what you choose to study and such, but even if they do you can always change your major and such so dont feel forced to pick a subject and obligated to stick with it. 
The cost varies a lot. I recommend you try out a community college as it is much cheaper, especially if done online. You can get your tuition cost knocked down by applying for things like fafsa, scholarships and grants. Colleges also help you with different types of loans. You can also go i to a degree that will pay itself off. You can go into something like HVAC or any trade job that will often pay you to attend because it is in high demand. 
Generally speaking most colleges will help you with this process especially counselors about the cost. There are financial aid offices and more, colleges typically walk you through this process but it would be a safe bet to start saving up a few grand.

1) I sent my idea in the group chat with references, and asked then to check it so we can talk about it next time‚Ä¶ next time came nobody checked it obv and then as she‚Äôs trying to search about the topic she find the same thing I did and brings it up as if it‚Äôs her idea, and keeps bragging about it.

2) The second one her and the other girl were discussing about today‚Äôs topic, they find some video on the internet shows everyone except me. I did look annoyed but ignored her and as soon as the class ended I left without saying anything.


I want a mature advice.

- I do kind of want to bring it up and send it in the group chat,especially pointing out what the girl did. But if I do, everyone would perceive me as the rude one and side with the other girl.

2399,t3_1ca5mx4,1713774923.0,"Context: I met a close friend‚Äôs friend (let‚Äôs call her Gina) about a two semesters ago. At first, the three of us got along well enough to hang out pretty frequently through the semester. However, this past semester, I noticed that when the three of us are together, she‚Äôll often exclude me from conversations and pictures, and focus on just my friend. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at first, but the more I‚Äôve hung out with Gina, the more I noticed her doing this. When I first met her, I could understand that maybe she feels awkward around me and doesn‚Äôt know how to include me in conversations since we had just met. However, we‚Äôve come to know one another quite well now, making me feel like her behavior is bordering on being a little rude and I feel like she goes out of her way to exclude me. 

On top of this all, there was a situation that happened recently that made me question what the heck was going on. My friend and I had made an impromptu plan to head to the mall after a long day of studying, and we decided to invite Gina as well. As soon as Gina got there, she began to adjust our initial plan. She wanted us to go out of our way to do some returns, and she started saying how she didn‚Äôt really want to go to the mall because she had gone recently. My friend began to side with her, which is when I politely tried to suggest that we stay to the plan my friend and I had made initially. Following that, she and my friend left to go make the returns, claiming they would meet with me at the mall as soon as they were done. Fast forward to about an hour later, I was waiting at the mall, and the two still hadn‚Äôt arrived. When they did, I found out that Gina has made the returns and decided to go to a thrift shop with my friend. 

What‚Äôs worse is through all this, Gina has a seemingly kind and happy go lucky attitude, making it difficult to confront her behavior. On top of that, my friend gets into this state of completely listening to everything Gina says. I‚Äôm honestly stuck, because my gut tells me something isn‚Äôt right since everything ‚Äúon paper‚Äù seems to look great. Any advice on how to deal with this?",2024-04-22 04:35:23

i am whitewashed af and i grew up being the only hispanic in a classroom until highschool. i still can‚Äôt stand my college. especially if you want to be premed - GOOD LUCK! it‚Äôs so exhausting hearing your white classmates have already shadowed multiple doctors and have internships ready to go bc their parents knew a guy who knew a guy.

if you go to a PWI, don‚Äôt take it to heart if the white girls don‚Äôt go out of their way to hangout with you. highschool is forced interaction, forced friendships, etc. college is so open and you have to put effort into keeing friends, the micro aggressions seriously come through. i was roommates with a white girl sophomore year and we got along super well and never had any arguments. we had the same sleep schedule, cleaning schedule, etc. she‚Äôd always chat with me in our room but the second we weren‚Äôt roommates completely ignored my existence. i was so upset and cried because i felt like it was me but then i realized her whole social circle is just white girls. if i was blonde hair &amp; blue eyes it‚Äôs so likely i‚Äôd be in her group.

My plan was to work during the gap year and figure my life out a bit more. But now it‚Äôs almost May and I feel like I‚Äôve succeeded with none of that. My mental health hasn‚Äôt been at its best for a couple years now. Losing my dad suddenly during the end of high school definitely impacted my motivation for college. The passage of time just feels different for me now. Sometimes I forget it‚Äôs 2024 and no longer 2020. Now that time is closing in I‚Äôm getting more and more stressed about the upcoming 2024 fall semester, which I originally wanted to be back in school for. Now I‚Äôm not sure if I will even meet deadlines, because I‚Äôm not fully sure what college I even want to commit to. More importantly, I don‚Äôt even know if I truly want to commit to Psychology. Yes, it is a very interesting subject, and I feel like I could get a handful of jobs out of it. However, one thing I have been realizing over the course of this gap year is my increasing interest in more nature-ish topics, such as marine biology and environmental science. Back in CC I tried a few environmental courses and they were alright, but some required courses in the future would be hard for me since some aspects of science I‚Äôm really bad at, such as chemistry and the more math oriented stuff. Plus the pay for many jobs relating to that field aren‚Äôt the best and very competitive. So overall, I‚Äôm just lost. I don‚Äôt want to take another gap year, but I also don‚Äôt want to commit to any schools when I don‚Äôt even know what major I want to commit to.

I'm currently a senior in high school and I got into a direct-entry PA program this is great and all but I don't know if I should pursue this option. Becoming a PA has been more of a recent thing as I only really found out about this profession in the middle to end of my junior year and I realized that this might be something I would enjoy studying in school for and pursuing a career in. In high school, I did enjoy science as a subject but I worry because of the general difficulty of the course. I'm afraid that if I were to go into this program I would maybe find out that this program isn't for me anymore and I would have to drop out or worse I would get kicked out for not being able to maintain the required gpa which is a 3.3. My other option is to go to a CUNY major in anything(I haven't had a set major yet) and minor in prehealth and get all my prereqs done and if I were to find out that I can't do these high-level science classes or if I find out I don't want to become a PA anymore I can just simply change majors. To simplify how I see these choices the direct entry pa program as high risk, high reward, and the CUNY option as a safer option for me. I don't know what to do as I feel like both choices heavily change my future.

I talked to the teacher and he said thats its still possible for me to pass the course (But he was thinking more of getting a D or maximum C-) and this would really bring my gpa down and its already bad enough (3.05). He also told me to think about it first before I make the decision because of how of I went this far in the class and only have two weeks left and that even though for my major I would not need calc II (or even Calc 1) that it would look good on my transcript.

My mother passed away when I was a teen and I don't have a good relationship with my father who lived out of state. I was told for years by my entire family, even by my own grandmother herself, that I was under legal guardianship as a child by my grandmother after my mother passed. Well last week, I was sifting through a pile of old papers of my grandmother's and found out it was actually something else called an ""authorization agreement of voluntary nonparent caregiver w/ permission from my father"", which is apparently different and NOT guardianship. I think my family mistakenly thought it was the same thing, they seem very similar. This means that I was not an independent student like I thought I was the last two years, but rather dependent.

I contacted my school's financial aid office, explained the situation, and asked them if they could help me correct my last two FAFSA's (22-23 and 23-24). However I was told that they are not interested in retroactively correcting older FAFSA's and to just be correct going forward (24-25 and on). So basically, I most likely received and used a Pell Grant that by FAFSA's criteria I may have not deserved. My college knows this now and is saying they're not going to worry about it and to move on.

That just...doesn't feel right though? Do I really just ignore this? Wouldn't the gov't department issuing these Pell Grants have an issue with that?

Business still isn't a bad idea today.  

But after the Dot-Com boom, Computer Science &amp; Software Engineering blew the heck up and are still all the rage.  

But not everyone wants such a hardcore technical education. It can feel too narrowly focused to some.  

Today, ***in my opinion*** the degree that provides you with a foundation to access the most career options is **Management Information Systems**.  

MIS combines three core competencies:  

Business Administration  
Computer Science  
Information Technology  

This isn't a degree in how to create technology the way a CS degree is.  
Nor is this a degree in how to create a tech startup the way a Entrepreneurial degree would be.  

MIS is all about how to solve business problems using technology solutions.  
You don't have to create the business, you just have to understand it.  
You don't have to create or support the technology, you just have to understand it's capabilities &amp; limitations.  

MIS doesn't care what kind of a business or employment-entity you work for.  

Medical Research?  
Investment Banking?  
Petroleum Refinery?  
Craft Beer Brewery?  
Federal Government Entity?  

All of those operations have internal operational challenges that can be made better using one technology or another.  

An MIS degree program will expose you to business &amp; economics, software, databases and infosecurity.  
If you suddenly realize any of those topics is ""your jam"" you are already on your way to understanding how to use whatever it is within an organization. So, now you can just fill some elective slots with deeper learning on that subject and you are on your way.

2590,t3_1caigkj,1713811019.0,"Hi, I am just writing this because right now I am not sure what to do. I (f) am an English and creative writing major at a pretty large university. I am a freshman and this past semester I took a workshop on intermidete fiction. From the beginning I was the youngest person in the class made up of mostly juniors and seniors. I should also let you know that there are only about nine people in the class. As far as I am aware I am the only person in the class who has gone to the professors office hours and asked for extra help. Everything three weeks I am asked to submit 20 pages of short fiction for the professor and the class to critique. This past week I was extensively proud of my work. I spent hours and hours writing and rewriting my work and submitted it four days before it was due. During class however, my professor (m) is supposed to give the class 25-30 minutes to critique my piece. Without giving too many details (they would likely bore you) my professor saved my work until the last minute and barley said anything. The class, despite being energetic to critique everyone else's work, clearly had not read my piece. My professor told me that my main character was not fleshed out and had no information, I was confused because the first two pages of my piece are details of the main characters life, appearance, background, and thoughts. He also mentioned twice that he liked that my piece took place in 1942 (in the middle of WW2) when the piece states multiple times that it takes place in 1939 just before the war began to truly affect America. The one other student in my class who gave me feedback and seemed to have read my piece, told me it was strong and compared it to the boy who we critiqued before mine saying that I had similar dialogue but needed more physical details. My professor however, compared my piece to a girls who went two weeks before me who wrote a fanfiction about an anime that was so confusing to read the whole class asked her to rewrite. Obviosuly I wasn't going to be an asshole and say mine was better but I sent this piece to my highschool english teacher and my grandfather who both said it was one of my best. After only ten minutes of crtitque where my professor basically told me to rewrite the entire thing, a student brought up taylor swift  and the professor quickly said ""I don't want to interrupt you girls discussing taylor swift"" and left the room. I was on the verge of tears. This has been a problem all semester of my professor not taking my work seriously and not reading it, despite reading every other males work. The feedback he left on my piece was two lines of the twenty pages that he underlined and said simply ""good historical context"" which feels very minimal for a professor who just asked me to rewrite the entire piece. Long story short, it is clear that he did not read my piece, assumed it would be bad and half-assed my edits. My male counterparts piece had line edits on every paragraph and a detailed paragraph written on the end of his paper explaining what he did well and how he can improve. My professor has been rude all semester and once even took my phone out of my hand in class when I used it to check the time (my male counterpart next to me texts constantly and the professor never comments let alone takes his phone out of his hands.) I am not sure how to address this professor or confront him for not reading my work. I know I could just ignore this but I took this class because I genuinely want to be a writer and want feedback that can help me improve. I am sorry this is so long I did not intend it to be.

Basically, I‚Äôm conducting a case study on a bank and have conducted surveys and interviews on their customers, and now want to interview a representative of the bank to get their take on it. Could be a teller, or a more senior rank. Anyway, my problem is that I can‚Äôt gain access to them. Despite very generous incentives and option to be anonymous, no one wishes to participate. The thesis would also not be published online either. Obviously, I should‚Äôve asked about this a long while ago, but I didn‚Äôt realize at the time that it‚Äôd be this difficult to find a respondent, and now I simply do not know what to do. This is the last data collection I need for the study and can‚Äôt really progress until I have found a willing participant. 

  
A lot of the questions that I‚Äôd be asking essentially carries the purpose of verifying the customers‚Äô thoughts and to be honest, the answers in almost all cases are obvious. Some are a bit ambiguous, and I think I could get a good understand by observing the tellers, and further I think I could generate some ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know‚Äô on the ones that I would be unsure about. 

  
So, with all this in mind, I‚Äôve gotten to the point of fabricating this interview instead. I realize this is wrong and obviously unethical, but I just don‚Äôt know what else to do if I‚Äôm to finish it up this semester, if at all. But obviously I also wonder how this could backfire. I do wonder if the supervisors routinely force us to hand out contact information to respondents, even if their participation would be anonymous/anonymised?

There are a number of variables here. If your school just uses the FAFSA, it would depend on how much you earn during the summer and how much you earn in total for the year.

If your school uses the CSS, it‚Äôs a guess. Assume that a little is fine, a lot would impact it.¬†

Either way, we are talking about your junior year financial aid when it comes to income (your sophomore year looks at 2022 taxes).

How did that go? This would have given you some insight into how the professor acts away from a group. Sometimes they're much more laid back when they don't have to deal with a whole class when speaking to you.

&gt;During class however, my professor (m) is supposed to give the class 25-30 minutes to critique my piece. Without giving too many details (they would likely bore you) my professor saved my work until the last minute and barley said anything.

I've been in a lot of workshop classes like this. This happens all the time, regardless of gender or age. This is a time management and classroom management issue, especially because workshops are 90% discussion. They also tend to run long and people get distracted/antsy/tired.

20 pages per student is a lot. If you have, say, 3 people submitting stories each week, that's 60 pages (if no one goes over or doesn't use formatting that is difficult to read). It can be hard to keep up with. This is why it's better to establish rapport with your classmates and go to office hours so you have some connections beyond the workshop for future feedback.

Is there a possibility that you're being treated unfairly? Of course. Before turning to the department chair/dean, though, consider if there is anything you can do to ask for better time management in the class, ask people if they can write down more notes for you to incorporate into your work (if they have time), try to have a clear but open-minded conversation about this over office hours, and so on.

I'm a 19 year old studying physics (B. S.) I'm currently a freshmen aswell. 

For the past year, I've struggled heavily with academics. I've lost all motivation and joy when it comes to learning and the such. I didn't use to be this way, but for the last two years its been my norm. 

I went to a state university, and it's getting very difficult to pay. I have around 1k left in my 529, and 1800usd to pay off before the start of May. There's no way I can fully make that payment on time. I wish someone pulled me aside and told me that it it's okay to take a gap-year or go to community college. I really wish I had. 

I'll be finishing this year with a GPA around: 2.5-3.0. It's the lowest I've ever gotten before. I'm probably going to lose my scholarships, but I can appeal them starting fall 2024 if I take some summer classes and if I do well in them. 

I feel super miserable at the moment. Even though I'm not depressed anymore, nothing feels worthwhile to me. I'm so afraid of having all these responsibilities dropped on me seemingly out of nowhere. It's stressing me out greatly. I wish I listened more when I was younger about these things.

My university forces freshmen to live on campus and heavily engage with the universety. We had to pay an extra half a grand for a mandatory ""Saddle-Up"" program. We have to live in these dorms that barely have functioning elevators, and it seems like nothing has been replaced since John. F Kennedy has been in office. 

I work at the dining hall, and the food that we serve out is sometimes inedible. On one of my first shifts, half of the bags of hot dog buns were contaminated with mold. Our supervisor cross-contaminated various areas, is trying to Union-Bust, talks mad shit to our chefs ""You're a terrible chef; that's why your restaurant failed."", and tons of other horrendous shit. Keep in mind, I'm forced to buy a meal-plan, so that's hundreds of dollars that I could've saved otherwise. 

My physical checks from the university didn't even cash in because the security codes were misprinted and missing on my checks. 

I'm really done with this university. I feel like that they don't care about me at all, and that they only look at us in terms of numbers-for profit.

¬†If you were my daughter (I have a few) I'd advise you to file a report because that's the only way anyone can possibly be held accountable.¬† If this professor used his position of power and authority to convince or force you to do ANYTHING, that's blatantly unethical and wrong.

Finding a grad program can feel overwhelming, I had around a 3.3 gpa, but I also was involved in a lab. Therefore, you can supplement your lower gpa with experience. Are you in a lab? You can cold email psych professors and see if they need help next semester? Or even during the summer? If not look for a job as a behavioral technician at a hospital. I think the only way you figure out what you want to do in grad school (or career wise) is by trying to find someone you can shadow, and/or seeing if there is a psych lab that you can volunteer for. I know that seems scary, but you also need recommendations for grad school. 

I am happy to answer specific questions to the best of my abilities. I am a first gen grad student, happy to pass down some knowledge (:

Hi all, I‚Äôll get straight to the point. I have Dyscalculia, and a very mild form of dyslexia. For many reasons I have chosen not to disclose this to my university/ not use accommodations.

2806,t3_1cav8vy,1713844911.0,"My 2nd year of uni is almost finished and somehow I've made it this far. Grades are not very good, not failing, but I really, genuinely wanted a lot better. This semester has also been the hardest for me so far, I even dropped a class and withdrew from another (that I will have to pay back). That leaves me with just 3 damn classes for the rest of this semester, and even then I STILL can't get enough done.

Basically I just don't study enough. Not even close. I procrastinate to no end and spend the entire day on my phone, at times literally with my hw ready to start right in front of me. I will go hours like this, from 2pm to 10pm, in the library, laptop and papers out and ready, without getting a single. thing. done. And that's the case for atleast 2/3rds of my days here. Genuinely. It's ridiculous. 

I know college schoolwork is supposed to take up a decent chunk of your time. You're going to do terribly if you don't put atleast multiple hours in everyday. I really don't want to do terribly. I can't tell you how much I want to be getting As, or even As and Bs. It seems like everyone else around me has it all figured out too, like they have it all on lock. I always see them studying for hours with no interruptions and no struggle. I just don't get it. It feels impossible for me.

I'm actually going to be taking a semester off after this summer due to this and a few other reasons. During this time I REALLY need to figure out how to achieve some level of self discipline because I WILL FAIL college if I don't. I am actually getting tested for ADHD this month (not even for these reasons directly but for others ones funny enough) so that may be helpful if I actually have it. Although I feel I could easily just be a lazy, undisciplined person. I don't know. 

Anyways enough of the rambling. That's my issue, and once summer starts I'll have half a year to figure it out so any help would be appreciated. Thanks",2024-04-23 00:01:51

2809,t3_1cavbjw,1713845142.0,"Hi everyone. I just turned 19 years old and started college last August, and my major is Communications. I am a freshman. Basically, when I was a senior I committed to a small private college about 30 mins away from me because I wanted to stay close to home, and when I started there I had the absolute worst experience and ended up transferring after a semester to my current university. While at my first college, I was extremely lonely and felt out of place because everyone played sports there, i had about one friend that didn‚Äôt treat me all that nicely, was in a bad roommate situation, did not enjoy classes, etc. I was taking Statistics and ended up not passing with a D-. I have always been terrible at math. My other classes were fine. Now I am at my current university, and I do love the school and area itself and it is a lot of fun here, except I am in another bad roommate situation and they are just so obnoxious and loud and dirty and I cannot ever just focus, along with other personal issues,  and the classes I am taking right now have been killing me. Because I transferred, I did not get to choose the best classes which I knew going into it and that was okay with me. Fast forward,  i ended up withdrawing from Spanish because it was not going well at all (its required so I have to take it online over summer) and my other classes are exam based and very difficult and I am simply not a test taker. I did bad on my first history one, and I am sure I did bad on my recent Philosophy one. So i am just worried and I feel very guilty because I feel so terrible about wasting the money from those classes. Im very grateful to have this opportunity, but it hasn‚Äôt been the best experience so far. I have hope for next year and I am signed up for ASYNC summer courses‚Ä¶

That was longer than I had hoped, but anyway, am I the only person that feels this way in college? How can I cope with it? I do study, I just don‚Äôt understand why it ended up this way. ",2024-04-23 00:05:42

Target offers a program where they‚Äôll pay for your tuition to go to a select number of schools. My family can‚Äôt afford to pay for college and I was never able to get a scholarship. But, my dream is to become a doctor (radiologist). So, I found a school on the list that interested me. The school Excelsior University offers an associates degree in health sciences, what I would like to do is to be able to complete an associate‚Äôs degree and then transfer after those 2 years to the University of Illinois, by that point I feel I will have a larger amount of money as during this time I will be working and living at home for the time being. Anyway, I‚Äôm wondering if this would be a problem in any way. Such as: will I have a lesser chance of being accepted to transfer since it‚Äôs an online school, will I not get the same experience and knowledge vs if I completed my schooling in person, and could this effect my chances of getting into medical school despite if my performance is exceptional, and is this degree an okay choice and will I still be able to have the same knowledge and accreditment to go down the path I want. I did check and the school is accredited. Anyway, I appreciate any advice or support.

My HS grades sucked senior year, but I still got into honors history and English because I rocked the ACT.

You should be fine and there's lots of reasons to do poor in HS. Sucky teachers that don't like you, life drama, all sorts of things. Mine was that I hated my HS and started just not giving a shit. Horrible people. teachers that did not like me, and spending a lot of time exploring relationships, jobs, evetual independence,  etc and letting that take priority.

Ds and Cs still pass for HS, though. That's the important thing where you get the HS Diploma.

You will still get in and most likely be able to dorm with your friend if they put all honors people into separate honors dorms. If not, so what? You will still get in. You'll just meet new people. Which can be cool to a degree.

BEAR IN MIND, though about college.

College flunks out around half the people that attend it. More or less depending on what you get into. And there's a good chance what you think you want to go into, you will change your mind.

The good thing is unlike HS, it's not every single day. But it's a lot more compact  and if you don't keep on top, it sneaks up on you. Especially if you are on your own with little oversight and let the party and dating scene or jobs get in the way. This is what happened to me my first attempt of college back in the day. Partied, dated, worked till too many missing 8 AM Algebra classes and a string of Fs and Ds led to the end of my college career until decades later.",2024-04-23 01:25:19

Another great way to look at this is to find a bachelor's degree you're interested in at a 4 year university you're interested in, find the course requirements online, then find credits at the CC that would transfer for their core/gen ed classes.

A major is your main course of study. A minor is an add-on, usually a lot fewer classes, but isn't as significant as a major. Kinda like pepperoni on your cheese pizza.

An associates degree is usually 60 credits worth of work, but a specific 60 credits. If you're transferring to a bachelor's program later, you don't have to finish the associates degree first.

The rep said there has been white students who have joined and transferred over to a HBCU and they didn‚Äôt have any issues. They joined teams, clubs, and were accepted amongst their peers.

Now, I will state this; 
With knowing that this is HBCU, I‚Äôd would be mindful of the history of the college and what it represents. Be open to different viewpoints and perspectives. I‚Äôll give you an example of a similar situation to yours;

Have you heard of the university Gallaudet University? It is university for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing population in Washington. While a large percentage of the student pop IS D/HoH, they don‚Äôt deny the entrance of Hearing students. They welcome them too. Just be mindful of the environment, history, and culture (language) of the school you are going to serves a particular population historically and culturally. 

I‚Äôd say; if that school was aware of you being non-POC and still offered and gave you the scholarship, then they are saying you are welcomed to be there. In addition to what you said about the culture shock; well think of it for many POC (and by my example of D/HoH people) in the overall world and academic/ work environment. Being exposed to the realities others face could be beneficial if you can recognize that. And well, again, others have been forced to do the exact same thing time and time again. 

As a biracial person, it might be easier for me to say this and might be harder for you to handle due to this. However, I will reenforce that they gave YOU the scholarship knowing who you are. Don‚Äôt let people stop you cuz it may be uncomfortable (unless it crosses the line of being reasonable)- if you are ok and willing to be put in this situation and learn from a HBCU; then go and be open to learn",2024-04-23 02:26:41

2903,t1_l0utjm9,1713855060.0,"FWS is really interesting socioeconomically that I just LOVE thinking about.

So, FWS pays your employer to pay you.  This means anyone who can tap into this as a funds gets a HUUUUUUUGE budget increase.  They can now hire 4 employees instead of one.  Or, they can offer quadruple the hours to one employee with the limits of 25 hour maximum per week during school weeks. But you probably aren't interested in the school side of it.

As a student it integrates you into a community who understand that your goal is school. The employer might truly believe in education as I do OR they might just have to acknowledge that you have a set class schedule and a hard limit of 25 hours a week.  In my office, we use this as a way to encourage student workers to look at there syllabi and plan out accordingly.  When are your finals and big projects.  It provides a level of mentorship that can easily be lost in a large college like mine, particularly for first and second year students who might have large lecture hall classes.  Similarly, a first generation student now has a support network of often recent graduates or young professionals to provide an example of where one could go (or where one might avoid).

It also creates a community of peers. People who can say to you ""take this class"" or ""don't take that class"" or ""yeah, my first year was super hard too, look out for finals week and let's party during spring break"".  This is so important, especially for students who are away from home or have few academic role models. There are studies that show your first semester tapping into FWS your grades drop, BUT following semesters have an overall increase in scores compared to students who don't use FWS. 

Can these same benefits be obtained without FWS? Yes, clubs can provide the same type of resiliency through community.  So can integration into your field of study or (some) frat/sorority or tutoring groups.  So that leads to the next bit: government.

The government wants you to be a good student and a good employee.  The government isn't a monolith and this will mean different things to different parts of the government.  But the underlying tension in financial aid, IMO, is the mix between exploitation and social production for education and labor.  The SAP standards and loans is the tangent that comes to mind. To get the loan, you need to maintain your GPA, class rate, and not be in college to long.  On the other hand the cost of school raises to meet the available money supply and lenders see you as a money churn.  FWS is the same, you HAVE to maintain your grades and Pace while it's also teaching you how to be a professional or not to miss shifts, often at minimum wage where the school is exploiting your labor.  This exploitation tension is also in the fact that socioeconomics define who has access to FWS or who has the privilege NOT to need FWS.  Are we accidentally creating and reproducing an underclass through generational wealth? Or are we providing resume experience and funding to chronically under served populations? Is it both? 

I think I've gotten off topic. The purpose of federal work study is integration, reproduction, and providing grant funding with strings.  As a student, you get community and supporters.  The school gets an effectively low wage workforce.  The government provides additional incentives for you to keep grades and Pace so you leave college and join the main labor market.",2024-04-23 02:51:00
2904,t3_1cay0er,1713855100.0,"Hello,

Recently I've been struggling with the thought that I should I go back to school and get an engineering degree. I'm currently in my mid twenties, hold two degrees (economics and political science), am a veteran and have a pretty solid career trajectory in my field. The issue is none of this really fits into engineering and I don't really know if I want to actually work as an engineer. I cannot justify going back to school because of this, but I also cannot shake the feeling that I am somehow missing out by not having studied engineering. I've always wanted to, but the school I attended didn't offer it and I've always thought I wasn't smart enough to try. Having now shaken that, my next concern is that I am too old and it does not make any sense to do so, however not doing so would seem like I am selling myself short. If I were to do this I would attempt Aerospace engineering. The best I could describe this feeling is that it is a bucket list sort of thing. I want to check this box and that really is my only solid justification for it, good or bad. 

I guess what this boils down to is that I am wondering if anybody has gone back to get a third degree and if so how did that go? Currently I should really be looking at a masters in my field, but it feels like the wrong path. That being said, pursuing engineering this late in the game could cripple my career trajectory, which I've only really had on track since leaving the military.

Some of - if not most of - the effect you're noting is that college excludes the bottom. Completing a college degree requires a certain minimum level of intelligence and drive - as well as time/money. So when you compare the group of people who have completed a college degree against those who have not, a major component of what you're comparing is the exclusion of a disadvantaged group.

It's akin to observing that those on the second floor of a building are faster runners than those on the first floor. Does standing on a different floor make you run better? No. But the stairs exclude all those who can't run at all from the average.

A good lesson to take away from your education is ""correlation does not equal causation"". When you look at statistics like these, you want to not only be able to see what they truly mean but what others are trying to imply they mean to sell their particular narrative.",2024-04-23 03:01:06

2944,t3_1cazxb1,1713863102.0,"Recently, I have faced racism and discrimination in my direction. I moved from Russia to the USA in 2021. Although I graduated from college there with a 4.0 GPA, I had to graduate from high school in America to be able to go to university. But, my grades at the university refuse to be accepted, so I have to take a lot of low-level classes in order not to waste time and money. At the moment, I have to take 9 lessons in total, both at the University and at the Community College. The situation is just happening at Glendale Community College, where I have to take the lowest drawing class. 

From the very beginning, my teacher seemed strange to me because of his statements and ""creativity"", because, to be honest, my teacher has a very low level of qualification and drawing. But I turned a blind eye to it, because I only need this class for evaluation. I handed over all the work on time and followed the instructions clearly, but they started to greatly underestimate my grades. Just like that, but at the same time trying to find some minor mistakes that were not even written in the task, and some were simply sucked out of the finger. Although, comparing the students' work, mine turn out to be of a higher level, just because I have an education already and extensive work and drawing experience, I'm not trying to offend anyone. But for some reason, almost all students get excellent grades, when my score is now 73%. 

To be honest, I didn't understand what was going on at all, I tried to talk to her, but she just stopped answering me. I was trying to find why she is doing that until I found out a couple of very interesting interviews that were taken from my teacher as an ""artist"". And the truth was revealed to me. She just fiercely hates white people, which is not even hidden in her statements. All of her work is based on hatred of whites and the rise of the black race. As a person who has not lived all his life in America, I absolutely cannot understand why she was angry at me, lol, I don't even have anything to do with all this movement. Perhaps my work offended her in some way, because one of my creative assignments came out on a political topic - and she underestimated it the most, but is this a reason for such an attitude towards students? 

I also tried to check the professor on Rate My Professor, but it turned out that almost all the negative reviews about her were deleted, but there was a moment that she attacked her students on social networks, as well as that she always gives a lot of extra credit to works, but for some reason she categorically refuses to give them to me. Due to the fact that these courses are held online, it is difficult to understand what kind of experience other students have. 

There is a lot to talk about this, but I will move on to the main issue of my post. What should be done in such situations? Should I try to keep trying to talk to the teacher who stopped answering my questions, or contact the college administration right away?

Im currently split between two choices. My dream is to go to UF under the Animal Sciences major and become a veterinarian. Unfortunately I didn't get accepted for the fall of 2024 however, I was accepted to UF online and Santa Fe Honors and just need some advice on what I should do next.

I want to know if one is better than the other in regards of transferring. I will be moving to Gainesville this summer so I am not really considering going anywhere else.

Ive read that going to a CC is a lot better because universities have to accept students from them but does that make transferring from UF online harder? or is it just less conventional. I currently have 100% Bright Futures (full tuition at any FL public school) so I wouldn't have to pay for the ""Optional Fee Package"" which allows me to use all of the UF amenities which is very nice because I can do anything another student can do just without having in person classes but at the end of the day my main concern is transferring that is what i want to do. I want the best chance to be an in person student at UF and tbh I am a little worried taking online classes because I didn't have a good experience during COVID. My counselor is telling me to just go to UF online and that Ill have a lot better chances but what im reading on most posts is the opposite so I would just like someone to clear the air.

Any advice or information about SF Honors and UF online would be very helpful. THANK YOU

\- for example, would i be able to get a job at UF as an online student, and have access to the same opportunities. Santa Fe honors has already sent me a lot of information about internships and volunteering opportunities which would be great for my goal of being a Vet.

You see, I come from a family where higher education wasn't a priority, and my parent didn't have the opportunity to attend college themselves. Now that I'm on the brink of heading off to college, they're struggling to let me go.

My parent's overprotectiveness has reached a whole new level, with constant worries and fears about what might happen to me once I'm away from home. It's like they can't shake the idea that something terrible will happen if they're not there to watch over me every second of the day.

I understand that their concerns come from a place of love and wanting what's best for me, but it's starting to feel suffocating. I want to spread my wings and experience life on my own terms, but their anxieties are holding me back.

I've tried talking to them about my desire for independence and the importance of pursuing my education, but it's like talking to a brick wall. They just can't seem to let go of their fears, and it's putting a strain on our relationship.

Has anyone else dealt with overprotective parents who are afraid to let their children go to college? How did you navigate the situation and establish boundaries while still maintaining a positive relationship with your parent?

At my college, you could start shadowing research as a freshman and I also did a paid research program at my college between my freshman and sophomore year. Then, I was able to do a work study program where I did work skills in my major while also getting breaks for finals, not having to worry about work scheduling me during a time I had class, etc. and then I did ANOTHER year of research as a senior with a professor I knew well. This all led to me getting an internship at a company and graduating with a full time job offer making $$$ and this wouldn‚Äôt have happened if I didn‚Äôt go to a 4 year school. 

2) have them take a tour of campus and even meet with the director of campus safety. Maybe you could arrange to text or call them at a specific time every day so they know you‚Äôre okay.

This is actually happening to a lot of people and I believe it is the times. Specialized jobs are hard to secure and I‚Äôd bet the people you know have had inner connections guiding them to those positions, especially where they were 18 at the time. Good for them, but this also kind of irks me that these things aren‚Äôt mentioned because I KNOW it happens and people act like it was all by their own achievements. Unfortunately, networking and connections go a heck of a longer way than education does. I‚Äôve known business graduates to get passed over a *business* position for graduates of a completely unrelated degree simply because a relative worked at the company and pulled strings. 

I‚Äôm not encouraging you to take on more debt, but I would encourage you to look into programs funded by the government. Hopefully something will offer more pay than you are currently finding. A number of my peers had a ton of funding via government for additional education that I wish I had known about. Also, get networking. Networking is so so important and it also lets you know what other opportunities are out there to take advantage of. It may even secure new jobs for you.

Some were very impressive jobs too (engineers, accountants etc). So if you really decide you want to make that change, it is NOT too late. It‚Äôs not about getting ‚Äúahead‚Äù, whatever that means in our current society, it‚Äôs about making a life that is happy for YOU. You may have to make some sacrifices though.

3017,t1_l0vx11p,1713878807.0,"Hi! Truthfully this is something I‚Äôm still navigating myself and I‚Äôm a sophomore in college. The thing is, you kind of just have to take action. With overprotective parents, it‚Äôs easy to fall into verbal battles about independence and the like because it‚Äôs a hot topic. The moment you start to take action, and they witness the aftermath, then you deal with it. But the idea is that you‚Äôre beginning to do things without there being a discussion. Spread your wings first, try to fly, see what happens. The best part about over protective parents is that if you do mess up, they kind of like it bc they have a reason to be there. That‚Äôs something you can find peace in. Even though the goal of gaining independence isn‚Äôt to mess up, it‚Äôs a part of the process. 

All of this is really just saying take steps anyway. Personally, this has been my remedy. When I asked or tried to talk things out, I got so much push back, so I ultimately stopped asking, I started doing. This is a slippery slope though. Parents do really know better in many situations, but if you feel smothered and are ready to start feeling like a young adult, which is what college will start making you feel, it‚Äôs best to start thinking and doing for yourself. If you need help, they will always love helping you (or perhaps, love thinking that they‚Äôre helping you), so you can ask when you need it, but try doing some things by yourself first. I think it‚Äôs important to start small. Start doing things in regular life that mimic independence, like a part time job, going out with friends more often, maybe even buying some small stuff for your dorm. Little things by yourself! By the time you get to a dorm or on campus, your feelings about their feelings won‚Äôt matter as much because you‚Äôll already be there because YOU have already made a decision about YOUR life. :) cheers ü•Çüí´",2024-04-23 09:26:47

The one rule that I stick to is to be open and honest about everything. Seriously. Everything. If it seems small and insignificant, talk about it. Discuss overnight guests, sleeping habits, noise levels, chores, cleanliness, food, boundaries, pet peeves, everything. I know this might seem weird or awkward to do, but this will help sooooo much, I promise. Get to know them as people, it will make everything easier. 

Psychologically speaking, you think differently than they do, so it‚Äôs going to be an adjustment when you interact with them on a daily basis in your shared home. From experience, they usually don‚Äôt notice things that seem obvious, especially things that can cause problems or that bother other people. Just talk to them, you will get used to them, and them to you. 

Hopefully you get to a place where you all become really good friends, it‚Äôs the best! I have seen many people advise people in your situation not to date your roommates; I am someone who is dating one of my roommates so I obviously have opinions about this. I‚Äôm not encouraging you, nor am I against it. If you decide to date one of them, you need to be COMPLETELY sure that you want to date this person long term. You would be taking a huge risk, and this WILL cause issues in your home. Be very careful, not only with the guy you might date, but the others as well. Again, communication is important here.

You don't want to immediately overwhelm yourself when first starting because that may lead you to wrongly believe you're not capable and get discouraged when the real problem is just not being used to a college courseload.

I'm currently facing a dilemma about switching colleges and could use some advice. I've been studying Management and Finance as double majors, but I'm considering a switch to a STEM field‚Äîspecifically Psychology and Biology, which really interest me but I dont want to waste these 2 year in the trash

The college I want to switch to accept 12 out of my 47 credits of my business degree, essentially meaning I'd be starting over as a freshman. My counselor advised me to stay and complete my double majors, but the next term will be fully online, which diminishes my college experience and I do NERVER want to do online classes again.

I have four years of FAFSA eligibility remaining, and I'm two years away from completing my current business degree.

I plan to switch  and start the new degree in STEM. To finance the remaining two years of my business degree, I would rely on external scholarships or take out a loan. Additionally, I'm considering enlisting in the military to pursue my M.S. and also plan to delay my graduation to preserve FAFSA eligibility for the STEM degree.

Complicating matters, my parents do not support my decision to transfer and prefer that I stay home with them, they also want me to finish college fast, but I dont want to face loneliness or be miserable after college.

Is it possible ? and what is ur guys opinion and advice ?

Thanks in advance

It was very stressful, more so than any job Ive ever had or my first experience at college. I went to community college to learn a trade when I was 22. 

going to trade school taught me alot, the instructors were incredible and focused on problem solving and thinking for yourself, as well as the greater theories that make cars and so many other machines work. they would intentionally lie to us sometimes to see if we agreed and then would correct us and challenge them on the fact that they were wrong

anyways, I worked as an auto tech for several years and decided I wanted more from my life

went back to learn Graphic design and video. it was considerably harder and more stressful. I did get a job that Im doing now and.. I dont really like it and its objectively not really a good gig

I dont really know if Im going to be able to get a job in a creative field at the moment. so far, not so good. I graduated and the job market was scuffed and now AI is looking like a serious threat and idk. Im not sure what I can do to get hired. I was hoping this job would help me get some portfolio pieces but, nah

I regret going to college sometimes honestly. I didnt really take any financial loss. my first time my parents covered it, and the second time I got grants scholarships and financing. because I was 26, I was considered independent from my parents income and I didnt make shit so I was considered poor enough to help, ironically because I am decently privelaged. 

if I had stuck with automotive I may be able to make a living right now

3124,t1_l0wx8b3,1713891514.0,"My observation about the many parents I've interacted with over the past 10 years:

In K-12, there is an expectation for parents to be heavily involved in their child's success, to the point where they are shamed (both socially and by the schools) for taking anything approximating a hands-off approach. For example, in many school districts parents are given access to the school's online learning management system and they're expected to monitor their student's progress on a weekly or daily basis. They are made to feel like bad parents (often this falls more on the mom) if they don't do this.

Then the student gets to college. And now we not only don't give parents access, we shame them for being so involved. It's a complete 180 on social expectations. Add to that the very difficult of emotions of watching your kid become more independent and encounter adult challenges for the first time, and some of them go full mama-bear/papa-bear mode.

Another commenter noted that there's some class anxiety at work here, and that's been my observation as well. Upper middle class parents at my school are much more likely to heavily involve themselves in their child's educational decisions. Parents who didn't go to college or have lower incomes are less likely to feel the same social pressure to be so involved in the college years. Middle class parents can go either way. (My campus has few ultra-wealthy students, so I don't know what the trends are for the 1%er parents.)

Also, the helicopter parent debate is at least 25 years old (if not older). Anecdotally, I don't think it's worse now. I think the particulars have shifted in response to technology, but the overall behaviors and social pressures are pretty much the same.",2024-04-23 12:58:34

So first off, I know there are a lot of people that have taken these many credits but I haven‚Äôt and have found even the 16 credits I take overwhelming sometimes. I hoped I could keep it under.

I am trying as much as possible to graduate in 8 semesters because that‚Äôs when my scholarship runs out and I won‚Äôt be able to afford school. The reason I don‚Äôt want to take on unsub loans is because they accumulate interest immediately.

Any advice please? Should I bite the bullet and take the 18 credits or take on the loans believing I‚Äôll pay it back when I graduate?

3267,t3_1cbj536,1713914205.0,"Hello everyone!

I (22M) graduated high school 4 years ago. When the world shut down, I got complacent with the day to day life of being lazy so I did not go to college right away. I regret it because I know if I didn‚Äôt let the distractions get to me I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this post and I'd be graduating college this year‚Ä¶

Anyways. I am going to my city's community college this fall to pursue a degree in Health Care Studies, which will then let me pursue becoming a X-Ray Tech or Respiratory Therapist.

I work a full time customer service job at a big health insurance company and they offer some great tuition assistance benefits. I hate the job as its destroying my personality but the pay is ""good"" for what I am doing and I have to stay to receive the benefits, naturally.  The problem is, the school path I am taking barely offers Online Learning so I have to decide what to do regarding my current employment. 

The department I work in does not offer part time hours; strictly 9-5 Monday through Friday. I wrote an email detailing my situation to my supervisor asking if there are other departments she could recommend me to apply to so I could stay with the company. She basically told me there's no guarantee that she'll be able to find me one and that if I could not find a solution then I should still pursue a higher education. She was saying that I can grow in this company but she knows its not for me.

So basically I'm screwed. 

  
I now have until September to save money and try to look for another job with tuition benefits and its just too much. I still have to take my placement tests, i cant talk to an advisor just yet because they aren't answering my calls or emails and I'm just so stressed out. As much as I do not like my job, i would love to still get the benefits. I applied for fafsa but I fear i make too much (I wont if i have to freaking quit) and I know the alternative is student loans and scholarships for having brown eyes,

3270,t1_l0ytdop,1713915033.0,"You need to talk to admissions/advising, and ask what the¬†**Teach-Out Plan**¬†for your degree is.

Policies may differ from college to college and state to state. But generally when a degree program is suspended, put on moratorium, or closed, the college has an obligation to make arrangements for the students enrolled in that program.

They might need to hire adjuncts, partner with another college, or provide independent study credits so that those students can finish their remaining credits and earn their degree. They may set a completion deadline for the teach-out plan, but you should be given the ability to finish your degree in a timely manner.

The college should be explaining their plan to students in that program, and if they aren't doing it pro-actively, you should start making some noise. Teach-out policies are a federal requirement for accredited colleges, so this is something they need to take seriously.",2024-04-23 19:30:33

It's going to happen sooner or later. Might as well develop that skill now. It's a lot easier if you're living in a different state of course, but you can still do it now. Just learn to nod your head and agree and say very earnestly ""I'm doing my best, I have to go study"". Just memorize that phrase. ""I'm doing my best, I have to go study"". Occasionally also drop the fact that half of your class is failing differential equations or whatever. But really, as an adult it is a super useful skill to learn to just tune older people out. Today we have all of the jokes about Boomers of course, but that mentality goes back a long way. In the 60s they used to say ""never trust anyone over 30"". The older generations' experiences inevitably go out of date, their expectations inevitably get unrealistic, and at some point you have to realize that they have gone from the people who take care of you to people who just add static to your life, and part of the skill of being an adult is just ignoring the static and moving on with what you need to do.

1) You can act now and push. No matter what you do there always is the human element: you have to do interviews; you have to report to someone; you have to work with others for a common objective; everything in life involves working and interacting with other people. I would say as someone who is kind of an introvert but being in the teacher and counselor roles, you have to pretty much keep your own personal feelings within yourself and you have to go out there and pretty much expose yourself. Jobs are all about being resilient and being adaptable to different situations which are strong markers for a successful candidate in any field. if you do have social anxiety issues, I do recommend may be starting slow like joining a club that you enjoy and getting to know members. You never know what opportunities you will have if YOU DO NOT DO IT TO BEGIN WITH. 

This also goes when applying for jobs: YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THE OUTCOME UNLESS YOU APPLY. IF YOU GET REJECTED, THAT IS OK - YOU WOULD BE IN THE SAME POSITION IF YOU DID NOT TRY!

Advise for you for as you continue on in your academic journey:
1. As others have stated, talk with your academic advisor on campus. If you aren‚Äôt close to them or have a difficult time reaching them (as that does happen sometimes) reach out to the advising department and see if you can be assigned a new advisor who might be easier to reach and meet with.
2. Most students connect with at least one instructor as they get further into their degree plan (junior and senior year is when the major concentration classes really start after those general electives are all taken care of). Instructors, especially in your major concentration, can be great people to talk about career goals and get ideas of what path you might need to take while still being in school. They may even know of some opportunities that you could get involved in that would help you later on as well.
3. Reach out to the student services department or special programs like career services, personal and career counseling or even TRIO Student Support Services if your school has one. These people are all specially trained and work with students on a daily basis helping them as they look at the workforce after college.

Keep going and keep doing your best. Remember your college experience is going to look different from everyone else around you and that is perfectly okay and very normal. Don‚Äôt compare too much.",2024-04-24 00:10:45

You MAY consider registering just so the accommodations are there in case you need them.

Any disability info is separate from your academic record; it's private unless you request accommodations (and even then, we professors are only told what your accommodations are, not your diagnosis). 

This is from my experience as a disabled person who used disabled services as a student (and did not always find them helpful, but did occasionally need the full force of the law to get a jerk professor to stop discriminating against me).

3420,t3_1cbqia2,1713936774.0,"I'm in a group project with 5 other people. One of them (who I'll call Cindy) has used ChatGPT and barely changed anything that it output for our past 4 paper submissions and subsequent presentations. We have been trying to get her to actually do reasonable work for the duration of the project, but she seems to be completely unable to understand our requests.

We have an evaluation form where we grade our project members after each presentation, and the percentage they each get determines their grade. Ex. we get a 90 on the project but my overall effort score from my project mates is a 50, i would get a 45% grade. My project mates are reluctant to give Cindy a bad grade due to pressure from some of her friends and worries that she will retaliate by giving everyone else bad grades.

I'm sick of all this, and recently realized I could probably make a good case for an academic integrity violation. We're in a few chatrooms and there is a little evidence of her using AI in her work which I may be able to pack into a personal report on her unethical behavior (not to mention the poor work quality), but I'm VERY worried that this will trickle down to everyone else who's actually doing work. We did, after all, submit multiple papers with barely-edited AI slop in them as a group. Every member of the group except for me used ChatGPT in some capacity, for ideas or for outlines of our papers, but nobody has done anything on the level of trash that Cindy has, and I don't believe any of those things are academic integrity violations.

Also, some AI detectors I tried to use online were dubious at best, reporting my own original work as ""potentially AI"", but reporting the paper as a whole as ""not AI"", and I technically cannot prove that Cindy's section is AI in its current state except for how it's formatted very different from the rest of the paper with a kind of question-and-answer format that does not fit what we are trying to do.

Does anyone have any ideas on what exactly I should do in this situation?

I figured I had a pretty high chance of getting in, and I did! My calculated gamble paid off, so I took half a year off from school and worked.

Hello! I went through a bunch of BS due to covid and personal reasons after I graduated HS, now I finally got my shit together and go to community college.

3466,t1_l10vi12,1713954215.0,"Hi! Aspiring nurse here too. I am applying to my community college's nursing program, ADN (associates in nursing) program for Fall 2025 and unfortunately I have to do it in the 4 year part time format because of my current work schedule and how much I work and the mandatory overtime for a good part of the year. I will be doing my BSN in an accelerated format once I am done with my ADN and am an RN I will look for an employer that will pay for my BSN as long as I work there for x amount of time. My job covers tuition so I will be able to get my ADN done with little to no cost to me. 

I already have an associates in Criminal Justice and I almost graduated with my associates in Marketing this fall until I realized how this is NOT my passion and I can pursue Nursing. I had no support system, sure I had a support system but only if I chose something *other* than nursing program. Pretty fucked up. But now I just turned 30 and I'm on my own now, so I can follow my dreams not do what other people are pressuring me to do. My community college requires 3 pre requisites - Elementary Algebra I, Essentials of Chemistry (B minimum in both) and Biology of the Human Organism (C minimum) and the HESI-A2 entrance exam with 3 subject areas, Math + Science + English. 70% on all main subject areas and 70% cumulative score is required. I plan on going above and beyond those ""minimums"". 75% or more of applicants who meet those minimums are accepted into the program. I am taking a prep course for the entrance exam to ensure I'm really ready. Also studying months in advance for it.

I would say that the hard part, especially in California, can be getting into the program. I'm in upstate NY. Some places require more pre requisites and/or a higher grade in all pre requisites than my program requires. What's on the entrance exam is different for each school. Some do TEAS and some do HESI-A2. My community college's nursing program itself will require me to keep a C minimum in all my courses. The first 2 years I do ""basic"" courses, before entering the core nursing classes, but half I have done with my Criminal Justice degree and I will only have A&amp;P I and II, Microbiology and Math for Health Sciences to do. So even though I am doing the 4 year part time evening classes program I will have a specialized schedule and plan to complete the program it may turn into a 3 year part time program rather than 4. I have to keep a C in A&amp;P I, A&amp;P II, Microbiology and Math for Health Sciences before I can continue onto the core nursing classes. 3rd year, all classes in both semesters need to be C's before moving into the next year. 

Yes nursing program will be a challenge, but it's not impossible. My ex's mom went back in her 40s to do it and she was very successful. I just turned 30 as I said above and I'm glad I have done other things degree wise to prep me for how to do school. Do not let the difficulty level discourage you from doing it. You could do what I am doing, ADN then once you're an RN find an employer who will pay for your BSN as long as you work there for x amount of time, or do BSN immediately after your ADN especially if places in your area hire nurses with their BSN more than nurses with their ADN. I may do it that way if I cannot find an employer who hires the way I want to, the whole pay for it if I work there for x amount of time. It can be done online 100% I believe because you don't need clinicals or anything for it since you're already an RN.",2024-04-24 06:23:35

If it was a required course and you didn't transfer credit for it in somehow, like via an AP exam or placement test score, or you took it as concurrent enrollment so it really was a college class, then yeah, you still have to take it. 

&gt;saying it‚Äôs impossible to transfer to a certain major/school (it was not)

It's not 'impossible,' and they shouldn't have said that, but unless you are transferring in ""guaranteed transfer"" stuff, which is mostly just Gen Eds, you almost always get hosed on credits, what previous classes you took still ""count"" towards your major, etc. At the very least, you're basically at the mercy of the new school/department on a lot of that. Going back to your ""I already took this in HS!"" complaint, they could very well refuse to accept a college course you took because they want all of their students to take ""their"" version of it.

Don't feel old or stupid. ""Should"" is an awful word - take it out of your vocabulary when talking about your life because it's referring to that society or your family or whoever else decided is the right path in life. But there is no right path - that is different for everyone. 

Also - I would get discouraging comments about how old I'll be when I graduate and whatnot - but here's the thing. The years are going to pass regardless. Initially I was going to do my undergrad part time, and people were like 'You'll be 40 by the time you finish, why bother?' Here's why: the years will pass regardless. I was going to get to 40 either way, so I'd rather get there with a degree. (Which I did!) You're going to graduate before you're even 30 - which leaves PLENTY of time for career and marriage and babies. I know it sucks being older than everyone but so what? Honestly, most classmates admired me for doing it regardless of my age - and I was often closer in age to my teachers than my classmates!! (I was older than one teacher and a month apart in age from another - but I remained excited to be there.) I even studied abroad when I was 34. The collective group of study abroad students at the university in Quito was about 40 students, and I was over a decade older than all of them! So group activities for the abroad group weren't usually my speed, but ai did make friends there. I also ventured out on my own a lot and found friends my own age. 

The point is - it's your life and you don't have to follow a generic timeline that you think is what people 'should' do. Also - you can't go back and change things or start school earlier or whatever. Your circumstances brought you to where you are now, and it is what it is. So the question you ask yourself is do you want a college degree? Because if you do - then get it and don't worry about being 4 or 5 years older than the other students. Honestly, being only 25 - your classmates prob don't even know you're several years older (unless you tell them.) Not that you should be secretive about it, but it's also none of their business. Be proud of yourself for getting your degree especially having to do it a little older, and if age comes up, consider that you may be inspiring to them. In grad school I made friends with a classmate who is 7 years younger than me, and he felt old and a little discouraged for being in grad school in his 30s- but he saw that I was excited to be doing it in my 40s and it inspired him, and he admired me for it. There were 5 of us from one class that formed a little group and we are all still friends to this day - our ages are 27, 28, 30, 36, and me at 43 - and these are some of the best people I know and I love this group! 

You can be discouraged and drag yourself through, or you can accept that this is where you're at and enjoy it and be proud of what you're accomplishing period. Who cares about age?

3603,t1_l12rzbp,1713980916.0,"Yes. I‚Äôm halfway through without a single loan. It‚Äôs not possible in every circumstance, but with the right combination of opportunity and planning, it‚Äôs very possible. Examples:

1. Qualifying for Pell grants and going to a cheap enough college it covers all or most of the cost.

2. Scholarships, either private or through the university/college. You can apply for more scholarships at any point during or before college!

3. Employers that offer tuition payment/reimbursement as a benefit.

4. Cheap school + lots of savings. Might be combined with living with family or other cheap/rent-free living arrangements.

5. Part-time school rather than full-time (costs more in the long run but cheaper in the short term so easier to pay) and payment plans.

I went to community college, then transferred to a cheap public university in-state. I qualify for the full Pell grant which covers the majority of tuition. The rest I‚Äôve paid for through small scholarships and my savings from working part time. I live with family to reduce living expenses.

If things continue as they are, I should be able to graduate without debt. If I ever want to do a master‚Äôs degree I‚Äôll see if I can work for an employer that encourages it through benefits.

How can I make this happen?"" lol Definitely apply for grants and scholarships, but those can be a lot of work and you may not get enough to cover everything. I recommend a cheaper school too, as most jobs don't require a fancy university, they just want to know you have a degree.

To start - fill out the FAFSA. This will tell you if you qualify for a federal grant or any federal loans (which you obviously don't want, but may need.) Beyond that, google grants for college, scholarships for college. Do that to find a wide variety of options, then google again and add your city, state, and/or major to the searches to see if there are specific ones in your location or for your specific degree. If you know what school, see what scholarships the school offers. If you are dead set against loans, make sure you know if you can get thru the whole program on those funds before you start or you might spend a couple years in school just to have to stop if the fund run out. 

Good luck",2024-04-24 16:14:21

Coming in as a freshman, I was part of the COVID lockdown experience having done virtual/hybrid classes up until sophomore year. I made the most of it by meeting people who are now my forever friends considering we will all be moving to the same location after graduation. I'm extremely grateful and happy for all the moments I had with my social life, academic trajectory, and extracurriculars. But... I'm not truly sad about it all going away and weirdly very very excited to leave college and explore adulthood. I understand that a lot of people miss their experience in college and hate adulthood but I'm looking forward to what's to come even if I might struggle. In essence, I think I'm bored of school in general. I skip a lot of my classes, I'm antisocial now even though I used to be tremendously extroverted, and I don't care that much about my grades compared to last year. I'm having an existential crisis because I want to ""live in the moment"" and try to cherish my last couple of weeks before graduation, but I can't stop thinking about what's next and it's inhibiting my ability to enjoy what's left.

I'm curious to know what other students who are also about to embark on this journey to adulthood also feel. How are you feeling about graduation? What's your takeaway? Furthermore, I'd also love to know what anyone thinks of my current sentiment.",2024-04-24 16:40:30

Additionally, community scholarships are an untapped goldmine (I won about 25k from local scholarships alone for reference). If your school does a scholarship notebook or portfolio type program, submit that and reap the rewards. Also, look into scholarship opportunities with your local rotary club or unions (trade unions, bar associations, etc...) depending on the degree you're gunning for. It's also worth it to ask your teachers if they know of any opportunities. You can also look into work-study positions, getting sponsored by an employer (this is big for business and accounting degrees in my area), or internships that will pay for a portion of your education. If you have family in the military, they might be able to pass a portion of their GI bill to you (heavy maybe on this one). If you absolutely end up having to take loans, do your best to avoid companies like Sally Mae, Navient, Rhode, and SoFi; and make sure that you look up the kind of plan that is best for you and stick to your guns even if they try to pressure you into another plan.

I had to retake it this semester because I had an evil professor that failed more than half the class last time I took it. I have already submitted for repeat/repair and this Life 102 course has way more work and is a lot harder. I have been dealing with some difficulties this semester and had to work harder to ensure that I pass my other difficult classes. I will admit that I have missed some assignments because of there being just so many.

I have tried to work with the professor, and she explains how there is a late policy of 1 day late means you get 75% and two days means you get 50%. She also explained that this applies to most assignments accept for the post-labs, exams, that stuff. Totally fine, some percent is better than nothing right? Except for the fact that all of a sudden, the assignment locks the moment it is due a few weeks into the semester and there is no way to even complete it for late grading. The professor hasn't really acknowledged this when I have tried to bring it up and suggested that I try to use a schedule to complete assignments on time. I did not come on this thread to complain about my problems it and I know I'm extremely lucky to even get the opportunity to go to college. It's been really difficult trying to navigate college as a first-generation student and I keep asking myself if this is all actually worth it?

Anyways, even when I do complete assignments despite knowing the material I still struggle with getting everything right, so I get like B+ or B- or C+ on the assignments I turn in. Which you think would at least boost the percentage or increase the grade at least a little bit. However, my grade percentage keeps going down regardless of whether I get an A on an assignment or if I get a C+.

I do not want to fail this class and have been participating more than the students who are getting better grades. Is there something I am missing or is it my own fault?

4. APPLY TO BE AN RA if you can (this can save and earn you so much money if you can)

 i was accepted with a full tuition scholarship i managed to get at a slightly farther away and much less strictly religious school that i really wanted to go to. i was so excited when i won the full tuition i worked really hard on my application and interviews and no one even cared. my entire family is disappointed in me and it took weeks of arguing for them to even let me go. i just paid the deposit, well asked my dad to, and i feel so awful for disappointing them even though i know id be miserable if i just did what they wanted. asking my dad for $200 to do something he doesn't even want me to do feels awful. i know ill be an adult and its my education my future and i cant let other people control my decisions because im scared to upset people my whole life but it really sucks. and i really didn't want to have to pay tens of thousands of dollars to go somewhere else when i have an option where everything's paid for. it seems like the best choice in every way other than my parents disapproval.

3755,t3_1ccdmw2,1714003114.0,"   I feel like I am struggling a lot, no, truly, I am. At first everything was sailing smoothly for the most part, all of the frustration from errors was all deserved on my end, such as having a missing grad for my midterm essay because I misses the part where it said it could not be late, and of course that was consciously the one time decision I made to accept a point deduction on a late grade JUST so I could make sure my formatting was proper for APA and that ny citations where in order, you know why? A previous mistake I made, the first of many I'm sure. I was struggling trying to find out the proper citation formatting for when referring to court and legal cases. 

   The way I process knowledge and new information may be different than most, I like to find a relation to what I'm learning to my everyday life, like if I've had an experience related to that topic or maybe it was something I vaguely remember reading about in 10th grade. I am fully aware and can recognize that yes, there may be times where my writing to the average neurotypical may feel like it's unrelated to the context, but often it is not that far off because typically they understand the overall point of what I'm saying aside from the 3 random sentences of how my brain decided to process and apply this knowledge to something I'm familiar with.

   Today after receiving an email from a professor, I feel more frustrated than ever and it feels like I'm being dismissed in a way almost. We had a discussion board of questions that overall related to gender identy and transgender people, like giving examples of how you can be respectful and knowledgeable when interacting with someone who has a different gender identity, identifying things you would probably have in common with a transgender person, and even the impact of social microagressions. Clearly, she already had a predetermined answer for a subjective topic. 
   I know the answer she was looking for focused on the mental health aspect of being transgender, the likelihood of depression and how the statistics of suicide rates increase. I know it, my friends know, anyone with common sense knows it. The issue was, I posed a separate issue to this perspective that is often overlooked, which is bodily mutilation, and I don't mean that in a derogatory manner because I support medical transitioning, but the relationship this has is when people have this expectation of how transgender people should look, what they do medically and/or surgically, etc. You are pushing this narrative of how you THINK it should be.
    The microagressions of invasive questions, asking whether or not someone has had 'THE' surgery, that is the reality of it. I had included a link to information about 'safe' phalloplasty procedures, which included images that showed the stages of the surgery. Mind you, again, it was a link and I didn't just upload a bunch of graphic images in my text itself, I had also included a note that it was NSFW and Graphic, that it a genital based procedure, so there is genitalia, thinking, this is okay because we are all adults and we are grown enough to have serious discussions over these topics, and apparently I was wrong. She told me that the images were graphic and unrelated to the discussion. Again, let's remember that I added a note by the link that explicitly stated that there was graphic surgical images but by clicking that link you consensually made that decision to view that.

   I don't feel it comes for an egotistical standpoint that I HAVE to be right or I have to get the last word in, because that's not the case at all. I feel that there is a form of bitter irony here though, considering this is a cultural and ethnic identity class, and we have had assignments to look at our identities, especially as white people, to recognize our white privilege, the stages of racism, how being passive isn't the better solution, and just being able to look at a variety of topics especially in the sense of marginalized groups and communities, but how are you going to go out of your way to tell your only transgender student that this is unrelated, when this is an experience that you have probably never witnessed or are completely unaware of? It felt so dismissive and invalidating to have her email me that, but also didn't quite say what could be better or what to avoid doing.

3810,t1_l1515o7,1714009911.0,"I'm sorry that you are having a tough time and that you feel like your experiences are being invalidated. One downside of courses like these is that they often assume no one in the course is actually from the minority group being discussed and assignments can be written in a way that alienate actual minorities.

Although I am not your instructor, perhaps I can shed a little light on why this may be happening--though, you should always follow up with your instructor, asking if they can clarify their exact expectations. I'm just going with what I assume happened.

I teach literature and often cover texts that have issues concerning gender, race, class, etc. And I have discussion questions on how the text handles those issues. It's not uncommon for a student to talk about the social issue in general, but not *how the text deals with it*. For example, we'll cover a text that deals with gender--but doesn't mention motherhood--and I have students write about how women were expected to do nothing but have babies.  It's not that this is a bad or totally irrelevant point in the larger scheme of gender roles--but that's not what we're focusing on, so it's not the time to comment that. For many instructors, the point of discussion questions is largely so the professor can evaluate how well you're engaging with the materials in the class itself.

It sounds like something like this may have happened. Your instructor was expecting engagement with the main talking points of the course, and you brought in a subject that was related, but not reflective of the course itself. The topic of surgery, how it's done, etc., are related to the topic of transgenderism--but it's not what your course is about. Discussions of the surgery, it's safety, etc., do not show you understand the concepts of the class itself. As for the images themselves, I do think it is important to remember that many people are sensitive to surgical images. Your instructor needs to check the link you provided in order to fully grade your post. So even if you warn that it's NSFW, they have to check it whether they want to see that kind of stuff or not.

This may sound contradictory, but in the future don't think of your discussion posts as *discussions*. Discussions involve bringing in new perspectives and generally related info. Instead, think of them more like reports.

So instead of saying ""microaggressions can be related to issues concerning surgery. Here's some more info on surgery so you understand why this is such a big deal"" you might say something like ""microaggressions can be related to issues concerning surgery. Here's why it is a microaggression to ask if someone has had surgery. I can empathize with this because people talking about my body would make me uncomfortable."" If you're openly trans in the class you may instead say something about why you wouldn't ask other trans people about their surgery status, or you might say ""here's why cisgender people can relate to this: they also would be uncomfortable if someone asked them about their bodies."" It's more boring and less conversational to write it this way, but it's showing you can mirror the ideas of the class back at the instructor. 

Again, check with your instructor for further feedback. You may ask if they can give you feedback on your next post before you make it. Don't be afraid to ask follow up questions if you don't understand their feedback.",2024-04-24 21:51:51

They are probably under the impression that going to a secular school will be what makes you turn your back on religion, especially if they don't know you don't believe anymore. 

I know someone who went through something similar, and eventually, his parents came around and accepted that he was an atheist. In the end, they just wanted to see him thrive.

Many schools will have a page or two somewhere on there website with resources for this. A bunch pop up if you just Google ‚Äústudying strategies.‚Äù

Another common issue is coming underprepared for class. You mentioned not understanding what‚Äôs happening in the classroom. If there are assigned readings, are you doing those beforehand? Do you ever look up anything outside of class to see if an alternate presentation of the material makes more sense to you?

If homework is an issue for you, do you start assignments early enough that you have time to ask questions before the due date? Do plan enough time into your schedule that you can complete assignments without rushing through them?

I also find that many students do not reach out until it‚Äôs too late in the semester to raise their grade/really engage with the material. Do you ask questions during class or attend office hours? Have you emailed any professors or TAs with questions? Are there tutoring sessions you can attend? Could you form a study group?

College can be a big adjustment and many students do not take to it easily, but don‚Äôt let this stop you if it‚Äôs something you want to pursue (and can afford right now). This is only your first semester, so you have a lot of time to turn it around. Consider taking a reduced course load next semester if it doesn‚Äôt affect your financials.

3882,t1_l15rzdw,1714022664.0,"Well the first thing you should do is focus on the mental health. It can be an extremely tough transition, and I've personally dealt with the same issues, only getting through with a lot of work. I wouldn't recommend the ""just push through"" tactic, as it really hurt me long term. You should see a therapist if you're not already, as there's almost always some root cause of the depression, it's just sometimes extremely hard to get down to, and without a therapist sometimes these issues can be impossible to really treat.

Next, I'd really analyze if school is for you. A lot of people go into school just because that's what you do, but for a lot of people it's just not for them. Take a year and try a bunch of new stuff. Many recommend trade school, which can be good for some, bad for others. You might be able to get an apprenticeship, which can give you a ton of opportunities. If you decide on the military path, go airforce, and get a technical job. These jobs pay the best and translate the best to civilian work. You can also just get an entry level job. Sales is the highest paying, but plenty of other roles can provide fulfilling work. It's just about finding what you enjoy.

As for your brother, just remember that you're likely just a quarter into life. You've still got so much more left to live, so don't think that you're behind just because you don't have a piece of paper. Life isn't linear, so don't feel like you have to follow this perfect path. For some examples, Liam Neeson was a substitute teacher and a driver before he began acting. Jack Ma(founder of Alibaba) was a teacher in China and had multiple failed businesses before starting Alibaba. I know people who've dropped out of school, joined the workforce/military, then went back to school later. Others have gone to school, hated the job they got with it, and went to a trade school. There's so many options out there, and life really is your oyster, so just try to make the best of it. Best of luck,",2024-04-25 01:24:24

I want to change my major and pursue something medical so I can get a serious job and help people!"" I told my parents about the idea and they were super supportive; they were perfectly happy with the art major too; they are incredibly supportive of any of my endeavors and I am so grateful for that.

Problem is now I am a 3rd year Biology major with an absolutely tanked GPA. I have failed so many classes since switching my major and the problem is I STILL have no idea what I wanna do with my life. My mental health is just as bad as ever, just now I'm three years deep in something else I am not sure what I am doing with. Every single chem class I have taken has whooped my ass, and I still have more to go. I wanted to so something post-grad, but my GPA and garbage transcript makes me feel like I really have no future in this field. I tried to reapply the arts program because I missed it and felt concern about the shift in major last year (2nd semester sophomore year), but they rejected my application as my GPA was too low (2.8)

My parents want me to try to finish the degree out just because I have already invested so much time and money into it.

3894,t1_l15wrnz,1714025656.0,"Take advantage of your school‚Äôs career center resources (and articles online) and teach yourself how to apply for scholarships. I applied for 30 as a high school senior and won I think 5 scholarships totaling around $3200. The scholarship season is January-February and might be slowing down now, but you can probably take out loans for the first year and apply to scholarships in the following years to cover the rest. I had a really good system for applying to scholarships and can send you some resources if you want; I can even help you find good programs in your state that would be open now. Also, there are some scholarships only offered to returning students in your department that you can reapply to each year.

EDIT: Also, get a summer job that allows you to work 40 hours a week and work as many weeks there as possible, like start right from the Monday after high school graduation and work right up until the Friday before you move to college. I‚Äôd recommend trying to get something over $13 an hour for the summer if you can. It sounds rough working full time but having the same routine every day is a lot like the high school schedule and having that routine can be easier than the ups and downs of college at times.

I found it hard to work more than 15 hours a week while in college, so once you‚Äôre there, try to find something with a high enough wage and definitely don‚Äôt settle for anything below $10-11. You can probably look on Handshake and apply to things during the summer so you can start work ASAP and make as much money as possible.

The biggest thing is living expenses. If you can live at home, you have no idea how much money that will save you. I would do it. If you can‚Äôt do that, financial aid and scholarships will cover part of the dorms while living expenses will be out of your own pocket. Do the math and figure out the cheapest option.

Full disclosure, I got lucky and ended up having a surprise college fund from a relative that I didn‚Äôt find out about until the summer before college, but I still did all of these things to ensure I wouldn‚Äôt struggle financially. There are ways to do it but it‚Äôs hard. You should strongly consider how worth it the program is. I disagree with the sentiment that community college classes are ‚Äújust as good‚Äù if you feel more at home and might learn better at the more expensive place; you‚Äôre investing in yourself and you pretty much get one shot at undergrad so you might as well go big or go home.

I have already talked to the Chairman of the english department about this professor, although the issue was not resolved.

My online english Professor does not post assignments for weeks at a time, does not post course material (no textbook), posts assignments with no clear instructions, does not answer emails.  

The first time we were without course work was 22 days, and I had emailed her 3 times within that timeframe with no response. I then emailed her boss concerned as she had stated she has medical issues and I was worried she may have had a medical emergency my college was unaware of. Turns out, she was neglecting the course, her excuse was ""grading"" yet the 4 assignments she graded were 2 short essays and 2 short discussion posts. Even with multiple other classes, she should not be this slow, plus this is an English 2 course.

The second time was 16 days, and she only graded 1 assignment when we were without coursework. She has only graded 5 assignments this year, all were submitted in January/February.

She posted the last of the assignments 2 days ago, and I feel as though she cramed multiple units worth of knowledge into 3 ""big assignments"" (as she calls them) with little to no materials to understand the assignments due at all. We have not been taught how to do these assignments, we have not been giving materials to understand the assignments and she does not answer emails. So how are we supposed to do this? 

Not to mention, I am scared she may not be able to grade on time. Her Rate My Professor states she has taken months after the course is over to put in final grades &amp; has given a whole class a zero on an essay (i assume bc she wasnt able to grade in time)

I emailed the department chair for a second time, although she is ""out of office without wifi""- although she left another email to contact for ""emergencies."" would this constitute an emergency? or should i just wait in my frustration?

If you choose to skip it, to save the prof some time looking for your exam, you could just give them a heads up you are doing it intentionally. As a prof, I actually appreciate it when students just shoot me a quick note to tell me they intend to fail that component, so then I don't worry about trying to track them down or waste time searching my office/house for an exam or paper that they never turned in.

For example, if the final exam is 40% of the course grade: ""Dear Prof X. I am not going to take the final exam. I understand that I will get 0% or F on the final exam and that this is 40% of my total grade""

Or if there is some line in the syllabus that says you are required to take the final to pass, just explain that you understand: ""Dear Prof. X. I have chosen not to take the final exam. I understand that I will fail the course.""

I have no clue what else they have going on in their life outside of my class, so sometimes it may well be the right decision for them to just take the hit on this or that assignment/course grade.",2024-04-25 05:07:34

3922,t3_1ccnpop,1714037685.0,"Hi. I'm currently a freshman going for a CS degree and I just feel thrown into the deep end. I barely scraped by classes last semester and that was with very good professors, TAs, and constantly camping every class office hours. 

This semester is just even worse. Professors are not as good (in one very difficult class, professor is just TERRIBLE). I don't know what to do. I try my hardest and I study, (and from what I've heard) even more than my peers. Yet despite this, things just do not click for me and I am just failing everything. I can't do anything myself, no matter how many times I'm shown how to do it, and how long I try. It all just flies over my head. After absolutely bombing my first CS midterm, I studied longer and harder for the second one, and felt that I understood the practice exams after going to professor office hours. However, after the exam (which was not entirely similar to the 3 mocks we were given), I ended up getting the VERY SAME (terrible, as in like mid 30%) grade. I just feel that it broke me. I need at least a 75 on the final to pass the class, and after what happened on my last midterms, I just feel its not possible. After seeing what happened on the last midterm, I just feel so hopeless. I can't even bring myself to study for the final because I've seen how its going to turn out. I know I really should try, but I just think its not possible. This is bleeding into all of my other classes now, too. I feel like I'm not going to pass any of my finals. 

One class (mentioned earlier with the terrible prof) I'm EXTREMELY failing but only ""passing"" because of overall grade curve. I don't understand anything that has been going on since my tutor left ME because he was too busy.  I feel like I got nothing out of this class either and my exam scores for this class have just been getting cut in half each midterm. I'm definitely going to fail the final. I haven't been able to understand the homework for weeks. I go to office hours often but again, other students are there so I can't hold a TA for a long time. I just want to cry every time I go and they explain something but I can't understand how to do it at all. I feel terrible leeching off my peers, but I truly just do not understand the material, and there is no supplement (e.g. no book the lectures are based off of, its JUST the bad lectures). 

  
What should I do? Is there anything I can do? Should I even try my hardest if it means costing a grade for another final? I feel like an idiot. ",2024-04-25 05:34:45

If you're struggling to get past a remedial high school course like college algebra and have 1.91 overall, perhaps the academic route is just not your cup of tea. It is not realistic with such poor grades to imagine going to a UC campus.  Even if you do get into a four-year college, I think you are right to doubt whether the time and educational debt is likely to pay off at this point.

3926,t3_1ccobw2,1714040107.0,"So for some context, I've been in CC for 4 years now, part of it is because of some housing/mental issues and the other part just generally having a hard time deciding what major to go into.

I don't necessarily enjoyed school, like it lowkey felt like a chore growing up until high school but I also didn't mind it too much? Maybe bc I was one of those kids that didn't have to put too much effort into trying to understand something so now that it is harder, I'm not in practice of working hard for school if that makes sense. But I also do like learning about things bc I do find myself in a rabbit hole when looking up things I am interested in knowing. That being said, I don't particularly like any one subject. I don't have a hard passion for anything specific. I hear so many people who are passionate about the science they go to but I don't match that energy. Chem is interesting to me, the way chemical react to each other and I enjoy the deeper reasonings as to why certain things happen but I also feel like I picked out of obligation(?). I do like baking and cooking and thought about hospitality and culinary but I know those fields are competitive and don't pay that great unless you are at the top. So that's also why I chose Chem. I feel it is similar to baking just more microscopic and I'm pretty good at science and math so this is where I am headed. I could study Bio or physics or business or psych but do I want to? No not really, so I picked Chem. It seemed like the only subject I have somewhat of an interest in that I was willing to put some effort into.

But because my interest for chem feels superficial to me, I'm still not sure if this the route I should go. I'm starting o-chem this fall and I'm lowkey scared bc I hear so many hard things about it. What if I realize I don't like it anymore? I wouldn't know know what subject to go into. I want to be financially stable in the future too. Plus I hear that to do anything good or get a well paying job, most chem majors have to go to graduate school. I'd would be so nice to have the title of PhD in my name but what if I can't keep doing school for that long?

I guess what I am asking is, what is it like for current chem majors who are a bit further along in curriculum or about to graduate? Did you have a similar experience just pushed through? Did you end up liking it more as you learned more?

Those who have graduated or pursuing higher ed, how about jobs? Are you working in a chem job right now with just a BS/BA? What about school work load? Those who stopped at a Bachelors, are you comfortable with work? What kind of jobs are you working? I only see toxicology, pharmacology, agriculture as job options online which all require PhD. What kind of work does a chem degree offer that isn't requiring a PhD or is there truly nothing at all where I have to keep pursuing higher ed? Higher education kinda scares me in that I am not going to be able to keep up with those around me, especially if I feel like I only like chem a little bit. Like I'm not going to be able to match their passionate energy in the future, maybe feel like a fraud who is only going into chem for stability/financial security.

Those who quit, why? What did you end up majoring in and how did you know you wanted to pursue that instead?

PS I am seeking out psychiatric therapy in the summer so maybe I'll change my mind on school but for now, I would say school isn't my forte but at the same time I don't want to just go straight to work or go into trades bc I don't really like any of the trades out there either.

  
Edit: Because of my history, I have quite like 7 Ws and I failed 2 classes. My GPA is like a 2.5 and I feel like I can't get out of it/idk how to get out of it and I think I'm feeling imposter syndrome bc I know my work ethic for school hasn't been doing so great. Again I'm trying to fix my mental but it won't necessarily make those Ws or failed classes go away either.",2024-04-25 06:15:07

3929,t3_1ccomen,1714041204.0,"Hi everyone - I need some advice. I feel like I‚Äôve made some gigantic mistakes in my career and education, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I can still turn things around.

For reference, I‚Äôm 28. I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theatre. I know, I know. 

I grew up extremely poor. But not in the ‚Äúpoor so you grew up being aware you have to make money‚Äù way, more in the ‚Äúso poor no one in your family has any financial literacy so you should really do whatever you want because you‚Äôll probably just be poor anyway‚Äù way. I was an empathetic child who loved storytelling and decided on a Fine Arts degree because I had no real understanding of career outcomes. 

Now, I‚Äôm an adult with several years of work experience under my belt and an entirely different set of values, but I‚Äôm feeling very trapped. 

I was a top performer in high school. 5‚Äôs on nearly all my AP exams, including up to Calculus BC. Every teacher I had pretty much begged me to not go into theatre, but I was a kid and had made up my mind. I went to a private university on a full scholarship because of my grades. Even though I studied theatre, I was still part of my school‚Äôs independent Honors College, completed a thesis, and graduated summa cum laude. 

But now, all I have is a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree and regret. 

I want to change my trajectory and go back to school for something I should have studied in the first place but I am finding it incredibly difficult to navigate. Once you obtain one bachelors, so many supports drop away. Admissions processes seem to be very unclear for second bachelors, and I have no idea how I would pay for a program without financial aid.

I know many people say to skip the second bachelors and go for a masters, but I am looking to study within a STEM field and many STEM masters (especially computer engineering - a top interest for me) would disqualify a BFA without blinking an eye. 

Are there any resources out there that could help guide me through this process? I appreciate any help or advice. ",2024-04-25 06:33:24

3950,t1_l16py98,1714045323.0,"Get (download) a text book on precalc/trig/both and try going through it. See how hard it is and if you get stuck on anything particular.

When working with a text book, firstly do not get intimidated with how ginormous some of them are (I believe it's mostely just a money making trick for them). Secondly, review the contents section and identify the areas you should start with. Thirdly, for the sections you are interested in read the theory but then DO THE PROBLEMS. Theory must be like 30% of your time and problems like 70%. If you are not doing problems you will never know how truly prepared you are. If you do not understand something, identify the topic and work on it. In my expericnce precalc books are pretty self-contained and you should be able to work on your weak spots using this text book, but if not try searching for like a school algebra text book and use it to work on you weak spot. Alternatively, if the particular topic seems real easy just scan through the theory and do like 10-15 problems to make sure you do understand it.

Now, regarding the text book, that's the hard part (for me) as i'm not an expert on precalc. The standart recommendations would be Precalculus - Mathematics for Calculus by James Stewart and others, or Precalculus by Michael Sullivan. But imo the books are unreasonably bloated and therefore easy to get lost in. Maybe try looking for a shorter text book with like a quick theory review and mostely exercises.

This uni is out-of-state so I'll be leaving my younger sibling with my dad, which I assume will be ok, but I'd still like to have my own four walls so that I can house my sibling should they emancipate or need respite.

There's no information online about how colleges monitor exempted students. Any help would be very appreciated, I've been trying to find info for months bc I already committed.

So for an associate's degree that requires 60 credit hours, your limit is 90 credit hours, regardless of what institution those credits are from (i.e., school-hopping won't get around the rule). The justification is that by that point, you are no longer making Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) toward your degree. This is actually the whole purpose of the rule -- so students don't ""wing it"" through college without making consistent progress toward their degree and expect financial aid to cover that. This is probably in the financial aid agreement you signed. The only ""reset"" is if you change to a totally different degree type, such as associate's degree to bachelor's degree. (This doesn't actually reset anything, it just raises the limit since the required hours for degree is now higher.)


For some types of aid, the decision can be appealed in extenuating circumstances. In *some* cases, changing your major after several years might count. For example, I had an advisee a few years ago who was a major in a health sciences field at one university and then transferred to Biology at my university. Because most of their health science courses can't be applied to a biology degree, they ended up with a lot of excess credits and had to submit a SAP appeal form with the university's financial aid office each semester to remain eligible for university and state aid (I don't know if this works for federal aid -- ask your financial aid office).

College naturally has a lot of social interaction, and you will probably enjoy it more if you made friends and did social activities on campus rather than go to class and back to your room to be in vr. Obviously don't just disappear on your vr friends, but many highs school friendships fade in college anyway as people start to find their own way in life and grow in different directions. I would imagine vr has limited directions to grow in, so make an effort to maintain some contact essentially but don't try to hold onto those friendships so tight that you limit your ability to make friends at school.

Also - social interaction and building relationships are important life skills that you will definitely need in life, and college is a great time to learn and refine those skills. These are soft skills you can't learn from a book or class - like empathy, conflict resolution, active listening, various forms of communication, assertiveness, reading the room, mirroring, coping skills, arguing, non-verbal communication, boundary setting, etc., and your own style of applying these skills. These are things that come from experience and practice and especially form exposure to a variety of different types of people so you can learn what you do and do not want from others in relationships and how to meet others' needs as well. (books can help guide you, but you have to apply what you read in real life settings). It's not to say you don't get some of this in vr relationships, but it's not the same. Plus 80% of communication is non-verbal like body language, body tone, facial expressions, etc., so if you aren't learning how to use and understand non-verbal cues well, you may not be a good communicator in a lot of situations.

Not to mention, the connections you make in college often help you later in life at jobs, networking, etc. If you take vr, I'd suggest limiting your time there and focusing on being present for the whole college experience.",2024-04-25 10:03:04

The long answer‚Ä¶

I did awful in high school (barely graduated) and I went to CC when I was older (worked for a couple years, had some health issues, then went). I loved CC and I was in tons of student orgs. Got great grades because I wanted to succeed, and I worked hard for that. Went into their honors program. 


I got into every school I applied to. Every single one. 



Prepare for a blob of information‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all from other posts I‚Äôve made on how I studied and succeeded in both my CC and my 4 year. 


**When reading**, I‚Äôd cover the paragraphs I was t reading so I would only see one paragraph at a time. I also kept the slide next to me and jot down relevant information to those slides. 

**When studying**‚Ä¶


**Here is something I put together on another post on** r/college that I got from the Disability Student Services department when I was in college, and from my honors program. 

* **Work in 40-45 minute increments.**
   * In my honors classes, they told us that after about 40 minutes, we stop taking in new information and that it was important to stop and do something else (get a drink, take a walk, use the bathroom, etc) and then start a new subject

* **Learning good study habits is also important**. (My DSS office had me try studying in the following format, which was surprisingly helpful)

   * **Week 1:** study slides/readings week 1
   * **Week 2:** study slides/readings week 2, review week 1
   * **Week 3:** study slides/readings week 3, review weeks 2 &amp; 1
   * **Week 4:** study slides/readings week 4, review weeks 3, 2 &amp; 1
   * **Etc.**

* **While studying...**
   * **Mark in you notes the things that are off for you**
   * **Mark things that don‚Äôt make sense**
   * **Write any questions you have that are prompted from the material (even if you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs relevant)**
      * This gives you stuff to ask about in class or in office hours, which demonstrates your drive to know the material and gives the professor a chance to mark down things that might be confusing for the whole class too.
   * **Go to office hours and talk to your Professors/Teaching Assistants!** You‚Äôd be surprised at how helpful they can be with figuring out how you can better study for your class. This only works if you know where you're struggling at (which you can figure out via the ""While studying"" bullet point above).


**Tools**

I used a surface pro and pen, but I know folks who used an iPad and pen. 

There are some great applications for computers and iPads that let you take handwritten notes right on the slides. Easy to mark up and highlight. 

I used onenote and it made my life so much easier. I just kept a handful of loose leaf pages for anything in class and everything else when into the onenote notebook. I even would take screenshots of stuff from the textbooks where I was struggling with stuff and mark that up too.

As for your second question about exemptions: Every school handles these things differently. If your school advertises an exemption and you feel that you fit those criteria, you should definitely email someone. Your school will have some office in charge of housing and dorms.

Dear [name],

I‚Äôm an incoming freshman at [school] and I was hoping to get more information about a possible exemption from the first year on-campus living requirement. What steps would I need to take to get approval to live off-campus as a freshman? Please let me know if there is someone else I should reach out to about this.

Thanks,

[your name]

While you wait for a response to that email, reach out to the family you have in the area (call, don‚Äôt text) and explain your situation and ask if they‚Äôre willing to claim you live with them. If they‚Äôre not, see if they‚Äôd at least be willing to house the sibling you‚Äôre worried about until you‚Äôre able to move off campus when the year ends if it comes to that.

Good luck, hope it all works out!",2024-04-25 10:34:47

4012,t3_1ccty90,1714056748.0,"Hi! I'm a first-year college student at a State Uni. Earlier, we had our last midterm exams. And it sucks. Not because I failed but at the same time, yes?

Wait, let me explain. 

Our professor on this subject has specific ways of doing things. She never let us answer on the testpaper, she will give us blank answer sheets. On our midterms exam earlier, unfortunately and for whatever the reason was, I wasn't able to hear her say that the way we should write the number of items should be divided into 3 like, 1-31, 31-40, 41-60. All I heard was the items was 1-60 items. Proceed to checking, I actually got good score, which was equivalent to 1.something. 

However, I was genuinely surprised to hear after the class (like dismissal, only few of us were left in the class) that the Prof. had instructed us to write the number of items specifically. As you can guess, which just set me into panic mode. Istg, I did not hear anything for some reason. My seatmate said that it was also late for her to warned me about it. 

My concern is the probability that she might score me zero for not following instructions, and midterm exams or any major exams is equi. to 40% in our grade. Though, I can confidently say I performed well on her quizzes (always scored beyond the passing score) and, got perfect score on her midterm project, also participates and got perfect scores on her oral recitations - these, the quizzes, oral recit and output/projects accounts to 20% each, bringing the total of 60% for class standing. 

Do you think, if she ever score me zero, will I still be able to pass with my good performance on her quiz, oral recits, and projects? or if not, can I still save my grade during the finals?

 Typically, after a certain point in the semester you are are past your college's refund period so the college considers the entire tuition earned by them.  If that amount was originally paid by Pell, anything that is sent back to FSA becomes your responsibility to pay and they will charge you for it. 

 Say your tuition is $10,000 and you paid for $6,000 of it with Pell.  If you stop attending and the college determines that you earned 1/3 of your Pell.  They will send $4,000 back to FSA.  You now owe an additional $4,000 to your college.  Because tuition is still $10,000 but now instead of covering $6,000 with Pell, you are only covering $2,000 with Pell.

We even did an entire report that involved us 3D printing an object for our topology optimization project and got a 0 ON THE ENTIRE REPORT, because last guy didn‚Äôt make it 1.5 pages it was 1.3‚Ä¶(oh fucking brother) 

Anyway finals are coming next week and the most my group can receive is a 60 not even a fucking D (61 is considered D). 

What should we do?

I'm a political science major whose taken full course loads each semester since I've been here but have  struggled greatly.

Please help me.",2024-04-25 14:32:49
4081,t1_l18fkm5,1714070190.0,"Here is what I suggest in your situation:

Email your partner once per day and CC your professor. Persistently try to convince your partner to show. Let them know the professor is CCed. Be careful about what you say and how you say it. Imagine your professor's chair or dean and/or some admin reading those messages at some point in the future. Explain what you said above, about what your professor is telling you. (You are doing this to establish a paper trail that shows everyone you're trying your best to do things the way that your professor instructed.)

Email your professor (once more). In that email, be very polite, professional, clear, and direct: 1) Tell them that you followed the instructions. 2) Tell them that you will continue trying. 3) State again that you are prepared to deliver the presentation either way. 4) Ask again to be evaluated individually should you end up being unable to persuade your partner to participate. 5) Follow through. 

If you end up being penalized because your partner did not show, email your professor one more time. Again, be very polite, professional, clear, and direct. Ask them to reconsider the grade based on all of the above. Ask the professor not to hold you accountable for something you have no control over. (You are doing this to establish a paper trail that shows that after receiving an unfair grade, you did your best to resolve the problem at the lowest level.)

Throughout all of this, write everything down. Maybe send emails to yourself wo you have no doubt later about what happened when. Avoid discussing the issue face to face. You want emails. If the professor tells you something in person that pertains to all this, send a polite email. ""Hi Prof, Just following up on our discussion. My understanding was that you said \_\_\_\_\_\_. Did I get that right?""

If the grade goes unchanged, find out how to formally file a grievance and initiate that process. Follow it through until your grade is corrected. Even if you decide that the drama doesn't seem worth it, you owe it to this professor's future students to get this stopped. 

Assuming that everything you've said is accurate and you haven't left anything out, your professor is entirely in the wrong and doing something patently unfair to you.",2024-04-25 14:36:30

4113,t3_1cd0s6y,1714074649.0,"For this whole semester, I've been stressed about grades. All the people in my school care so much about them. I'm doing a biology degree and do research so all everyone talks about is doing good in school. I cried when I got a 75 on my physics exam because I felt I was letting everyone down. I studied hard for, what felt like nothing. Today, I got a 69 on my O-Chem 2 exam and I don't care. I studied hard for it, gave it my all, and it's okay. I learned that a Rad-tech program I want to go into only cares about the grades of select classes. Those are the only grades that matter and I haven't taken those classes yet. Since learning this, the feeling of anxiety I get is gone. The worries of my GPA are gone. I've been doing nothing but stress, lose sleep, gain weight, and I think my hairs falling out. But now I feel as if I can enjoy getting my education, because it feels like nothing matters. Sure, when the time comes to take those important classes I can deal with the anxiety then, but with finals coming, I just don't give a shit anymore. Not when I see those numbers, I think I need to improve. I stopped thinking of them as scary things to avoid. I would probably feel the same way if was lower. In the end, I was putting so much weight on these things when now they don't matter. If things don't work out in the end, then I'll figure something else out. Instead of stressing out over giving your all to something and getting nothing in return, seeing what 100% can get you and not getting what you want in return, and feeling the soul crushing shame of failure, we should learn to go with the flow and understand that the anxiety of school isn't worth it and you can be fulfilled with whatever you do in the future. Don't feel like a failure if you gave 100% to something and get nothing. As long as you're trying you're learning and that shame you feel from failing can only be treated from the humbling experience of you coming to terms with you being your worst enemy. I hope this helps someone and I hope that anyone can offer any other ideas. I am open to having my mind changed and my words challenged ",2024-04-25 15:50:49

I am currently making roughly 60,000 a year (29.50/hour) and have been there for exactly 3 years now. In my currently role by the end of 2025, the aerospace technicians will be making $47 dollars an hour, which will be roughly 97,000 dollars.

However, as I've been working here, I've began to notice that this is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I am currently in undergrad with about 2 years remaining for PA (physician assistant). After undergrad, I will apply to get accepted into PA school and then complete 2 more years to get my PA degree. So roughly 4 years at least. I am at a crossroads in life where I have a stable job that has very good benefits and pay for my age, however I feel that a career in medicine has been something I have always wanted to do and I feel that if I don't try it at my age, I will regret it later on in life. I am wanted to quit my job in order to live at the University to graduate so I don't have to take 2 to 3 classes a semester. Everything I have is paid off, the only payments I have are insurance (70 a month), phone bill (50 a month), I don't own a home, and I have ($11,000) in students loans currently (which are currently in freeze since I am currently in school).

I'm currently working in a psychology lab (my major is in the psych department), but I'm feeling a bit uncertain about my role and opportunities for growth. While I'm heavily involved in the grunt work, I haven't been given many chances to participate in the scientific side of things like writing or presenting, despite expressing interest and asking several times. 

I've noticed that some of my peers in similar positions seem to have more opportunities for involvement in research and presentation. I wonder if this is because they‚Äôre mostly in ‚Äúharder sciences‚Äù outside of psychology.

I'm torn between staying and hoping for more opportunities or looking for other ways to gain the experience I crave. Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",2024-04-25 17:15:07
4162,t1_l198ceh,1714079716.0,"There's nothing scary about answering a few questions from investigators, especially since you say didn't take the key.  The only thing to remember is to give simple and direct answers to their questions, keeping strictly to the facts as you know them.  Be as accurate as possible with your answers, don't embellish or speculate unnecessarily.  For example, if you know you returned the key at 1:40 pm, don't say you returned it at 1:30, because timelines matter.  On the other hand, if you have no recollection of what time it was when you returned the key, just say so.  Don't make up a time or guess because, again, timelines matter.

Also, remember that, in the end, they're looking for an ordinary key, not a stolen file containing the nuclear launch codes, so in the grand scheme of things, this little investigation is pretty trivial.  Whoever stops by to ask you questions isn't going to be a master CIA interrogator running a diabolical scheme to trip you up.  The person who talks to you just wants to find out what you know and if you observed anything that needs further investigation.

I've found that chatting with a website that generates personalized guided meditations based on specific issues I'm facing can be effective, and be effective in under 15 minutes. When I describe my sleep troubles during the chat, the website creates an audio guided meditation that addresses my exact needs. I usually set the background sound to alpha waves, which are known to facilitate deep sleep. This setup has significantly improved my nights, so much more pleasant not waking up from bad dreams.

For concrete problems like sleeping troubles, these personalized meditations work unexpectedly well. Although I'm still working on resolving bigger, more complex issues, techniques like 'deconstruct' and 'reframe' in the meditations are game changers by helping me see problems from new perspectives and rewire my emotional responses, making it easier to tackle what keeps me up at night.

The optimistic view is that most accredited programs will do everything they can to maintain their accreditation, and the warning gives them great incentive to address the problems. A good program coordinator will say ""this needs to be addressed, now"" and administration tends to listen.

This professor has commented multiple times on every group's project with many unreasonable comments, and constantly belittling us by saying ""I don't even understand why you would write that it makes no sense"", etc. 

I have turned in every assignment on time and I took this class because it was synchronous, I work constantly to support myself. 

My professor emailed us on Wednesday stating that ""our project is awful and unsuitable"" (we have followed all guidelines and included everything with correct work- which she confirmed and corrected). She stated that we have to all meet with her on either Friday before 4pm, Saturday, or Sunday or else all ten of us will fail. She has also emailed another group saying the same thing.

It is hard for all of us to agree upon a time because we are all working, busy, taking children to school/watching their own kids etc. I am even attending a funeral this weekend and she said there were no exceptions. She has sent multiple emails after saying we will fail.

My question is, is all of this ""OK""? If 9/10 group mates can meet, she has states she will not accept it and we will just fail the class. Do I CC the Dean? I am not sure how to handle this. I have emailed her and she has just kept saying we will fail. I also tried googling what to do and couldn't find much.

I'm at a crossroads in my career path and could really use some advice. I'm torn between two options and could use some insights or experiences from those who have been in similar situations.
Option 1: Continuing with Teach for America for a teaching credential and master's degree.
Option 2: Pursuing Cal State LA's counseling program for school-based counseling and an MFT license.
I'm passionate about education and making a positive impact on young lives, which is why Teach for America initially appealed to me. However, the prospect of becoming a school counselor and helping students on a more individualized level through the counseling program is also incredibly enticing. The biggest benefit of TFA is that I would have a full time job whereas CSULA would be longer schooling before I get my main job. My end goal is to be a school counselor but do want experience in teaching and counseling I just don't know what's the better option right after undergrad.

4293,t1_l1a3w0g,1714092058.0,"I‚Äôm in my forties and I went (back) to college late, and I‚Äôm fine. Hell, I‚Äôm having the time of my life. I did the party thing when I was in my twenties, never got married, never had kids. I get treated like an elder statesman, where students come to me with questions because I‚Äôve got my shit together and I made the mistakes they don‚Äôt want to make. 

A weird thing happens when you get older: You kind of just want to help people. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs some kind of parental thing that comes up as a matter of age or if it‚Äôs just an understanding that the world doesn‚Äôt revolve around yourself, but I just want students to be as excited about the material as I am. I tutor a lot of students, and I draw the line at the ones who just want a grade and don‚Äôt care about the material. I‚Äôll tutor CompSci students who are struggling with DSA all day long, but only if they really want to ‚Äúget it‚Äù on a fundamental level, and I‚Äôm not even in CompSci anymore; I found another calling. But, I still tutor them because I really enjoy DSA, and I want them to enjoy it, too.

I‚Äôve got a job offer on the table from my current employer. I‚Äôve got one on the table from a former CompSci classmate, in case I ever decide to go back to pushing pixels. Hiring managers don‚Äôt really judge age (because over 35, they legally can‚Äôt) because employment is largely transitory today. The days of working for a company for 40 years are gone. Today, if you work for a company for ten years, you‚Äôve outlasted most of your bosses. They care if you can do the job.

That said, it‚Äôs not a meritocracy. Whom you know is more important than what you know. Where I work, we are gaming out the scenario where we get a big contract, and that‚Äôs going to mean rapid expansion, and every conversation includes the words, ‚ÄúDoes anybody know someone who can do that?‚Äù The devil you know is better than the devil you don‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs often better to take someone who is 90 percent as good as the best candidate because you know the 90-percenter‚Äôs flaws, but you don‚Äôt know the 100-percenter‚Äôs. And then there‚Äôs the sunk cost of going through a hundred or more applications, vetting, hiring, training. Why do that when you can hire someone who will hit the ground running?

When I did my last go-round at community college, before ambling off to university, the students who were my age or older had one thing in common: They were hungry; knew what it was to be beaten down and get back up again. One of my lab partners needs a job for the summer, because my program requires major-related work hours in order to take capstone, and I told him I‚Äôd ask my boss about an internship, but I put the biggest fucking caveat on that recommendation you‚Äôve ever seen. He‚Äôs not hungry; he‚Äôs desperate, and those are two very different things. He‚Äôs unrepentant (except to professors) about using ChatGPT to write papers, which suggests he wants to do the bare minimum; has zero work history; he‚Äôs an average intellect on a good day. I don‚Äôt want him as an intern. So I picked the freshman who said, ‚ÄúHey, I have to get 400 work hours by senior year,‚Äù because that kid is planning ahead. He‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ maybe not hungry, but knows he doesn‚Äôt want to be hungry, and that‚Äôs just as good.

You‚Äôre right about older students being confident in their decisions. There‚Äôs an absolute truth in Steve Jobs‚Äôs Stanford speech, where he says (hang on, let me grab the quote):

&gt; When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: ‚ÄúIf you live each day as if it was your last, someday you‚Äôll most certainly be right.‚Äù It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‚ÄúIf today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?‚Äù And whenever the answer has been ‚ÄúNo‚Äù for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

He‚Äôs right. If I had finished out my CompSci degree, I would have eventually thrown my chair through the window and escaped like Chief at the end of Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest (spoiler alert for a movie that‚Äôs before my time, let alone yours). That‚Äôs why I tell students, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt declare until you‚Äôve taken the intro class. If you enjoy it *and* you‚Äôre good at it, that‚Äôs your major. If you fail at one of those conditions, take electives and Gen Eds. Find something else. You don‚Äôt want to be in your thirties and dreading every day of work. It doesn‚Äôt get better; doesn‚Äôt get easier.‚Äù

So, if you have older students in your classes, ask them questions. They‚Äôve had life throw things at them, and they‚Äôre usually happy to tell you how to recognize an incoming curveball or to duck when a fastball is coming for your head. They recognize the signs of impending doom, and a lot of recruiters would rather have somebody who‚Äôs been around the block than someone who‚Äôs never left the house. There‚Äôs a lot of soft skills they tell you to learn in preparation for the workplace, but experience, in life or in a professional field, is something you don‚Äôt get until after you needed it.",2024-04-25 20:40:58

I'm currently in the midst of a gap year and I'm eagerly anticipated beginning my studies in the fall. The advisor informed me that I could start selecting my classes and electives. However, a snag arose when I discovered that I needed to submit my ACT scores for placement in English and math classes. To my surprise, I was told that my scores had expired, (I didn't even know that was a thing)

The advisor suggested I take placement tests in both math and English. These assessments, somewhat akin to the ACTs, would take approximately two hours each and necessitated thorough preparation. Additionally, I learned that I could opt to take these tests either at the college or from the comfort of my own home, provided I had a computer equipped with a webcam for monitoring purposes.

Upon delving into research on these placement tests, I quickly grasped the significant time commitment required for adequate readiness. This realization triggered a surge of stress, reminiscent of my high school days. My gap year was initially intended for delving into the world of coding, a passion I feared might now take a backseat to the demands of test preparation.

Consequently, I now find myself grappling with doubts about my readiness to resume full-time student life. The prospect of once again being consumed by academic obligations, mirroring my high school experience, looms large in my mind.

I don't know if resuming my studies is the best idea for me because it'll just bring my my stress, anxiety, and possibly depression, and some of that has already returned when I when I heard about the assessment tests. I'm really not sure on where if even wanna go to college.

In high school, if you are older than the grade you are supposed to be in, you are behind.

Your buddies move ahead. You are left in the dust and possibly lose friends and now have to hang with younger people.

There's a stigma to it.

You were a flunkie.

During my second year's Fall sem, I did pretty bad which led me to have a gpa below 2.0 and was placed on probation again. My spring semester has almost ended and I think I may have failed 2 classes and might not be able to get my cumulative above a 2.0. I spoke to my advisor regarding it, but she told me there is nothing for me to worry about but she does not know that I would fail two classes this semester. My uni policy states that if a student on probation fails to achieve a gpa of 2.0 in his/her subsequent term of enrollment will be eligible for dismissal but the action would be taken by overviewing the student's overall academic progress under the deicison of the Dean and academic advisor.

Normally there‚Äôs at least a couple students who are naturals at it in class. If you can, try to become friends with them so they can help you out. BECOME GOOD AT EXCEL AND USE IT! Very important for some classes because excel can virtually do all the work for you. 

Good luck!!!

""Oh, I'm traveling this summer"" or, ""Oh no, I don't want to work this summer. I want to chill before I actually have to get an internship next year"", etc.

As someone who has been working 60 hours a week every summer since high school, and working during school, and basically working over full time any time they go home, this just eats away at me and makes me feel awful. I wish I could afford to have a fun, stress-free summer. But instead, I'm working two jobs to pay for my education.

I managed to get a great scholarship to this school, and it was the cheapest school I applied to (that's why I go here), and I pay 24k a year to go here (before anyone says I should've gone to a state school, they're all the same price as this one, and my state university (the big one) is 32k a year, so yes, it's cheaper) I'm incredibly grateful for my financial aid package (50k a year), because this school is over 70 grand full price... and there's people here who pay that.

I also don't qualify for any subsidized loans due to my family income, and I'm trying to avoid debt, that's why I'm working myself so hard.

It's just so, so hard to hear about the lives of people who don't have to worry about paying for school. It's even harder that my roommate is rich as hell. She told me the other day that shes ""so glad she doesn't have to work this summer because shes going to do fun stuff every day"" fully knowing I'm dreading the summer.

I was stunned honestly because it‚Äôs 2024 and I‚Äôve only had positive feedback from everyone in my life. I‚Äôll admit, I was a BIT nervous to tell my parents because I was afraid they‚Äôd think I was making a huge financial mistake, but they were thrilled! 

Overall, I think there are still enough mean/rude/crappy people out there who DO talk negatively about people starting school late or ‚Äústarting over,‚Äù that many people are afraid of backlash and judgment. But all of that judgment only comes from people who hate their own lives (even subconsciously‚Ä¶) and so it makes them feel better about their own lives. For example, ‚ÄúI know I hate my job and I might‚Äôve even picked the wrong career, but I make bank and at least I‚Äôm not THAT old person having a midlife crisis and going back to school when I‚Äôm 30 or 40 or 50‚Ä¶I mean, that HAS to suck more than my life right now, right? That‚Äôs admitting you‚Äôve failed, and I haven‚Äôt failed because I have the house, car, and job title to prove it!‚Äù 

The person who insulted me also assumed I had failed my first career. It was quite the contrary. I was burned out and killing myself every day after 20 years of the same shite day in and day out. I needed a massive change and I‚Äôve honestly never been happier! 

I‚Äôm broke‚Ä¶very broke, (before I decided to go back to school I was spending money carelessly because it was the only way I felt better after work every day. So my savings got depleted pretty fast after quitting and starting school. But I‚Äôm so happy. The ‚Äúbeing broke‚Äù part was what scared me the most, because I was way too attached to money and had been willing to give my life up (literally) for it. Not any more. But I had to take that leap of faith to realize it‚Äôs not as bad as I remember. It sucks having to choose between medical tests or food‚Ä¶or whether you can afford the gas to visit home to help your parents with a family crisis, but it‚Äôs still truly worth it. I just needed to remember that to shake me out of my old pattern and habits. 

Turned into a novel here but ultimately, the above reasons are why insecurity exists. Because naysayers are too scared to take a leap of faith themselves and push their own fears on others. ‚ÄúI could never go back to school at our age. My brain is fried and I‚Äôd fail every test I bet‚Ä¶‚Äù (one of the nicer naysayer examples lol) or worse, ‚ÄúAre you sure you can afford that? How are you gonna make rent if you only work part time? There‚Äôs no way I could ever go back into debt again and eat ramen every day‚Ä¶ugh‚Ä¶that sounds like a nightmare!‚Äù 

Then when that friend does it anyways, the naysayer changes their tune a bit because it seems ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù that anyone could go through with something like that if they can‚Äôt. ‚ÄúDid you hear John is going back to school? Yeah‚Ä¶I dunno‚Ä¶a lot of mid life crisis these days, eh? He could barely keep up with his life before so how is school gonna work? Welp‚Ä¶let‚Äôs just sit back and enjoy the sh*t show I guess!

As far as different careers: if you're interested in working with/helping people, maybe something like a guidance counselor? Or human resources? Or if it's the science of it then maybe a different STEM track?

I don't know your reasons for leaning towards psychology but I think if you can narrow down your motivation then that will help.


And if you decide you don't want to go to college right now then that's okay. It's a really difficult, expensive decision and sometimes going straight into the workforce can help you figure out what you actually like doing.

Hi, I‚Äôm an international IB student and i‚Äôm interested in biology, sustainability, technology and business.

 I have two conditional offers from one from UNSW for engineering honours which requires me to get a 33/45 in ibdp and is a 4 year course. For UCL i applied for bioprocessing with b&amp;m which requires me to get a 38/45 in the ibdp which is a 3 year course so if i go here i will apply for a masters in the uk/us after grad. While CWR is an unconditional offer for an undecided major and is a 4 year program. 

I‚Äôm not to sure on which to pick, money is not a big problem for me but ideally i would like to a pick a school which will offer me the best job placements and opportunities. 

My end goal is to start and or work for a sustainable tech or biotech company. 

Location wise i prefer sydney or london cause they are cities and i love cities but i wouldn‚Äôt mind living in ohio for 4 years. I really want to do a masters in the states either ways hopefully at ucb or Stanford. 

Ik these are very different schools but idk which would be better. Ranking wise UCL is the best followed by UNSW then CWRU. I feel at the end of the day they all provide great opportunities. CWRU also has the bonus of not being tied to a major. I do get some sort of flexibility with UNSW as i go as an undecided engineering major and specialise in year 2 i think (correct me if i‚Äôm wrong). UCL on the other hand the course is super interesting and a very small cohort and is only 3 years but from what i heard some professors are not that great there. I feel like all unis have shitty professors tho so im so confused. I wish i had gotten UCL earlier then i would also have more time to think my decision through but what can we do.

I wanted to go back when I was 29. I was like...is this for me still? Am I too old? But honestly it was the best idea. I've made so many new friends. I was also much more responsible. Professors have pointed out my work ethic and someone said to me, ""I find the students who aren't right out of high school and have built a work ethic treat college more like a job where it takes priority and you feel an obligation to do the work."" That was exactly it. I had also known what it was like to hate the job I worked, at Walmart, and knew how badly I wanted to succeed this time around. Sure, I did feel insecure at times when my friends would talk about college parties and stuff and invite me, and I'm just the only 30 year old surrounded by a bunch of 21 year old kids...but shit I did it.
