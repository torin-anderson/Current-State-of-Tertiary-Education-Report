if you want money for college, you should submit a [fafsa](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) if you are eligible to do so. [click here](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements) to review eligibility requirements.

2021-2022 school year: use the 2021-2022 fafsa, which opened october 1, 2020. requires 2019 tax information.

2022-2023 school year: 2022-2023 fafsa will became available october 1, 2021. requires 2020 tax information.

**first time? here's a step-by-step guide.**

* create an [fsa account](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch) (also known as the fsa id). this is your legal electronic signature to sign the fafsa. it's linked to your social security number. if you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well, assuming they have an ssn. if your parent already has their own fsa account, they must use that. if your parent does not have an ssn, they must print and sign the signature page manually, then mail it in.

* gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (w-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.

* start the fafsa! if you or your parent are given the option to use the irs data retrieval tool, use it! it will drag tax information from the irs straight to the fafsa and save you a lot of time.

do not guess on the fafsa. if you have a question, post here or [contact the federal student aid info center](https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact).",2021-08-26 00:27:46,"['question', 'feder', 'student', 'fafsa', 'financial_aid', 'verif', 'must', 'post', 'thread', 'want', 'money', 'colleg', 'submit', 'fafsa', '2021-2022', 'school', 'year', '2021-2022', 'fafsa', 'open', 'octob', '2020.', 'requir', '2019', 'inform', '2022-2023', 'school', 'year', '2022-2023', 'fafsa', 'becam', 'avail', 'octob', '2021.', 'requir', '2020', 'inform', 'first', 'time', 'step-by-step', 'guid', 'creat', 'account', 'gather', 'necessari', 'document', 'includ', 'bank', 'statement', 'inform', 'w-2', 'return', 'record', 'untax', 'incom', 'stath', 'fafsa', 'parent', 'given', 'option', 'data', 'retriev', 'tool', 'drag', 'inform', 'straight', 'fafsa', 'save', 'a_lot', 'time', 'guess', 'fafsa', 'question', 'post', 'contact', 'feder', 'student', 'info', 'center']","[(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 7), (10, 1), (11, 1), (12, 1), (13, 1), (14, 1), (15, 1), (16, 1), (17, 1), (18, 4), (19, 1), (20, 1), (21, 1), (22, 1), (23, 1), (24, 1), (25, 2), (26, 2), (27, 1), (28, 2), (29, 1), (30, 1), (31, 2), (32, 1), (33, 2), (34, 1), (35, 2), (36, 1), (37, 2)]",[0.01851852 0.01851852 0.01851852 ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

i enrolled in college directly after high school in 2018. went to school from fall 2018 until fall 2020. i had to leave school due to personal and family issues (mostly dealing with undiagnosed adhd, which is now diagnosed, and my mom's severe alcoholism, which she has since gotten help with). 

before, my grants and minimal federal loans were paying for my expenses quite well, but when my moms alcoholism started getting bad, there happened to be an issue with my fafsa and some missing tax information. i tried getting my mom to help me find the appropriate tax forms but she was always too incapacitated and i had no clue what i was looking for or how to get it, so it all ended up on the back burner. 

i tried contacting the school during february or march 2021 and they said it was too late, i was no longer considered a student and therefore would be ineligible to get federal aid or aid through the school to pay off my outstanding balance of $10k. 

now it's been 2 years, i've been working really hard on fixing my personal and family issues and i'm ready to go back hopefully summer of 2023. i already plan on calling my schools admissions and financial aid offices tomorrow, but is there anything you could recommend i do?? would it be worthwhile to try looking into maybe grants or scholarships available to children of alcoholic parents? also, could i use private loans from like collegeave to backpay what i owe from 2020? any advice is greatly appreciated, this has been a major struggle for the last two years and i'm finally ready to take my education back and finish my degree!! for reference i am in indiana. 

**tl;dr** had some tax issues that affected fafsa, alcoholic (now recovered) mom couldn't help me submit it all in time so i became ineligible for aid. owe the school $10k. trying to get finances back in order now so i can go back to school in 2023. thank you!!",2022-10-10 06:00:43,"['complex', 'situat', 'hope', ""y'all"", 'help', 'enrol', 'colleg', 'directli', 'high_school', '2018.', 'went', 'school', 'fall', '2018', 'fall', '2020.', 'leav', 'school', 'person', 'famili', 'issu', 'mostli', 'deal', 'undiagnos', 'adhd', 'diagnos', 'sever', 'alcohol', 'sinc', 'gotten', 'help', 'grant', 'minim', 'feder', 'loan', 'pay', 'expens', 'quit', 'well', 'mom', 'alcohol', 'start', 'get', 'happen', 'issu', 'fafsa', 'miss', 'inform', 'tri', 'get', 'help', 'find', 'appropri', 'form', 'alway', 'incapacit', 'clue', 'look', 'ended_up', 'back', 'burner', 'tri', 'contact', 'school', 'februari', 'march', '2021', 'said', 'too_lat', 'longer', 'consid', 'student', 'therefor', 'would', 'inelig', 'feder', 'school', 'outstand', 'balanc', ""it_'"", 'year', ""'ve_been"", 'work', 'realli', 'hard', 'fix', 'person', 'famili', 'issu', 'readi', 'go_back', 'hope', 'summer', '2023.', 'alreadi', 'plan', 'call', 'school', 'admiss', 'financial_aid', 'offic', 'tomorrow', 'anyth', 'could', 'recommend', 'would', 'worthwhil', 'look', 'mayb', 'grant', 'scholarship', 'avail', 'children', 'alcohol', 'parent', 'also', 'could', 'privat', 'loan', 'like', 'collegeav', 'backpay', '2020', 'any_advic', 'greatli', 'appreci', 'has_been', 'major', 'struggl', 'last', 'two_year', 'final', 'readi', 'take', 'educ', 'back', 'finish', 'degre', 'refer', 'indiana', 'issu', 'affect', 'fafsa', 'alcohol', 'recov', 'could', 'help', 'submit', 'time', 'becam', 'inelig', 'school', 'tri', 'financ', 'back', 'order', 'go_back', 'school', '2023.', 'thank']","[(2, 1), (3, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (9, 2), (10, 1), (18, 1), (24, 1), (31, 7), (33, 1), (34, 1), (35, 1), (37, 1), (39, 1), (42, 1), (47, 1), (49, 1), (52, 1), (55, 3), (57, 1), (59, 3), (60, 1), (61, 2), (63, 2), (65, 1), (69, 1), (73, 1), (76, 1), (78, 1), (91, 1), (95, 1), (98, 1), (110, 1), (122, 1), (135, 1), (136, 2), (139, 3), (142, 2), (143, 2), (154, 2), (155, 1), (159, 2), (181, 1), (182, 1), (184, 1), (187, 1), (192, 1), (194, 4), (195, 1), (196, 1), (216, 1), (220, 1), (266, 1), (275, 1), (276, 1), (282, 2), (284, 1), (290, 1), (303, 1), (308, 4), (316, 1), (355, 1), (358, 1), (360, 1), (361, 1), (373, 1), (385, 1), (394, 1), (395, 2), (404, 1), (426, 1), (446, 1), (447, 1), (452, 1), (460, 1), (486, 1), (494, 1), (500, 2), (501, 1), (503, 1), (504, 1), (505, 1), (506, 1), (507, 1), (508, 1), (509, 1), (510, 1), (511, 1), (512, 1), (513, 2), (514, 1), (515, 1), (516, 1), (517, 1)]",[0.         0.         0.00806452 ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

so i talked to them about it, and really no progress has been made. i’ve just decided to put some space between me and them and focus on my degree now (i’m in my third year). they really aren’t worth it and the excuses they gave me made no sense at all
i’ve also decided to just focus on and rekindle past friendships (people who actually care about me). i also just want to note that i didn’t wrong them in any way. this all just started when i moved out. 

so i'm in a group of 6 friends, but of late i feel like they've been purposely leaving me out. we were all roommates but i moved out of the house due to financial difficulties, and now it seems they all know inside jokes that i don't, they all have more experiences together without me. 

we agreed to meet up for lunch and chat today, but they left without me(two of them drive and one was supposed to pick me up) without even giving me a heads up i'm scared to confront them about this. i don't have any other friends at school. and i feel like if i do bring it up, they'll turn it against me 

i thought college friendships would be easier and healthier than high school ones?

if i were you, i’d think carefully about the types of friendships that you want to have. it sounds like this group ain’t it. making new friends sounds like the move, but it can be challenging. as cheesy as it sounds, being unabashedly yourself can be extremely powerful, as your potential friend group now becomes a self-selected pool of individuals who are more likely to share your interest, and more likely to want to genuinely know you as a person.",2024-04-17 14:47:25,"['’_ve', 'made', 'sure', 'diversifi', 'number', 'type', 'friend', 'cover', 'base', 'alway', 'type', 'connect', 'want', 'person', 'serv', 'uniqu', 'role', 'meet', 'uniqu', 'need', 'friend', 'group', 'friend', 'neurodiverg', 'form', 'think', 'has_been', 'help', 'person', 'understand', 'relat', 'fit', '’_ve', 'also', 'made', 'effoto', 'specif', 'spend', 'amount_of', 'time', 'friend', 'mine', 'comfort', 'incred', 'meaning', 'convers', 'peopl', 'thought', 'never', 'talk', 'genuin', 'meaning', 'connect', '’_ve', 'peopl', 'life', 'go', 'miss', 'friend', 'deepli', 'graduat', 'think', 'care', 'type', 'friendship', 'want', 'sounds_lik', 'group', 'make', 'friend', 'sounds_lik', 'move', 'challeng', 'cheesi', 'sound', 'unabashedli', 'extrem', 'power', 'potenti', 'friend', 'group', 'becom', 'self-select', 'pool', 'individu', 'like', 'share', 'interest', 'like', 'want', 'genuin', 'know', 'person']","[(35, 1), (36, 3), (47, 1), (54, 1), (57, 1), (65, 1), (68, 1), (87, 1), (112, 7), (113, 1), (118, 1), (132, 1), (144, 1), (157, 1), (170, 3), (194, 1), (196, 2), (211, 3), (221, 1), (229, 2), (245, 1), (252, 1), (255, 2), (282, 3), (290, 1), (293, 1), (298, 1), (300, 1), (354, 1), (361, 1), (388, 2), (469, 1), (473, 2), (492, 1), (522, 1), (543, 1), (552, 1), (554, 1), (568, 1), (602, 2), (613, 1), (617, 1), (637, 1), (660, 3), (673, 1), (681, 1), (708, 1), (712, 1), (716, 2), (717, 1), (727, 1), (728, 1), (729, 1), (730, 1), (731, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

so when spring break comes and goes, and the miniterm starts again, i reached out to the department chair as the class still wasn’t started. i was informed that they were in the process of hiring the professor. that leads us to now, a week before grades are due for graduating seniors. the school finally hired the teacher and he is now attempting to fit 45 hours per class into the span of a week and a half. that is 90 for me, since i’m in both. there’s two other graduating seniors who are in both as well, along with two other graduating seniors who are in one of the two.

having to study, make sure my assignments meet deadlines, meet with other students for study groups and extracurriculars made me feel like i was part of something bigger and more important. every day, i felt like i had a reason to get out of bed.

doing this work thing day in and day out, i constantly wonder why we subject ourselves to this kind of adult life. i know a lot of people are fine with it, but i'm terrified of decades of my life passing doing the same monotonous grind without much to show for it.

a lot of people i've spoken with about this have suggested the complete opposite: that college makes them feel like they have no purpose, but work gives them a sense of identity and fulfillment. but being in class, surrounded by students that see the classroom as a means to an end, a path to the workforce, it fills me with existential dread that i can't shake.

i might get downvoted for this haha. but i’m actually in support of talking to them. 

the word “confronting” is usually associated with negative feelings that could make it seem like you’re risking everything. if you look at it with the perspective of “they’re my friends, i should just tell them how i feel” it feels less doomy and could make it a bit more comfortable to open up to them. word choice is really key. 

for example, instead of saying “you guys make me feel left out” you could say “i have been feeling left out” or “i feel like i’m missing out”. when we begin with “you” or the other person, it makes them feel like you’re attacking them causing an unproductive dialogue. instead, tell them how you feel. because in the end, we really don’t know what the other person thinks or has to say and starting off with “you” makes it seem accusatory, and we really only know how we feel. when they say “why do you feel left out” you can always answer with “i notice that i’m not understanding inside jokes or that i’m not participating in events that have been planned, and i just want to know why.” then you can explain your perspective and they can explain theirs. it’s about understanding, not so much about who is right or wrong because nothing is ever black and white. i’ve learned this the hard way. 

discussing how you feel doesn’t have to be confrontational. and besides, when you open up just a little in this way, you will absolutely know if they are your friends or not. one thing i learned in therapy is that your feelings are not facts. so to save your mental health and unnecessary conflict, it’s always best to just talk it out and ask because believer it or not, most of the time we are overreacting. lastly, if things don’t turn out well, you can always be proud that you advocated for yourself and your boundaries. it’s a win in my book.

honestly, is it ""normal"" (normal as defined by something the majority of people do)? no, it's not normal. most people in college get into relationships. even most high schoolers at least date. that being said, if you choose not to, there's nothing wrong with that.

however, and this is a big however, you are only young once. being in a relationship at high school/college age is a special kind of wonderful you won't get again. i'm in my late 40s, i know a number of people who regret wasting their youth not having had any fun during it. i had super-restrictive parents, and i ended up going wild a bit when i got out of there, and don't regret a second of it. i now have a great job, own a house, etc. so you don't have to throw away your youth to succeed in life. don't let bitter people tell you otherwise.

do you think maybe you are overdoing it? why do you give so much to every friendship? do you think those people wouldn't be your friend if you didn't give?

i think if you want a friend that you can have that super close and caring connection with, you should pick a single friend and really focus on spending time with them and getting to know them, maybe even at the cost of some of your relationships with other people. you don't have to give to all of your friends because a lot of friendships aren't ones where people really expect to give or take, they are surface level. if you want a give and take friendship, you've really got to invest into one person to make them care about you.

432,t3_1c6zhf9,1713434318.0,"hey there reddit people ! i (21m) think its about time that i ask for help. i would really appreciate if you read all of it.

as a kid, i was very jolly, happy and full of life. i had many friends. as recent as my class 10th, i had a nice group of close friends. we did everything together and we are still in contact through socials as we are now in different colleges. so i know how it feels to be in company of nice friends. 

but after 10th, we started studying for competitive exams in our home isolation which was traumatizing and full of taunts and then covid lockdown struck as well and after all of that, the person that i have come out as now, is absolutely opposite to what i was.

when i joined my engineering college in 2021, it was difficult for me to make friends. obviously there were students with different personalities and i couldn't fit in with everyone. i observed everyone for a while and tried networking with a few but it just won't work. they were always close to each other more than me. i always felt ignored and uninvited. leaving my self respect aside, i even tried changing friend groups to feel liked somewhere but nobody includes me with them.

i am not cool like them. i dont drink and smoke. i dont go to parties and clubs. i am already shy and introverted &amp; i think after those two years of isolation, i have also become a serious faced, boring person. and people cannot relate to me anymore. i have no personality.

people around me are having huge friend groups. they are always seen together, talking and laughing. they go out to watch movies and on trips. they have girlfriends and boyfriends who love them and what not. i don't even have a friend circle. i have become a loner.

i really want people to love me and invite me to their plans. i want friends who treat me with respect. who share secrets. who play sports together. who study together. who dont make me feel left out.

and the joke is, i am writing all this, when college is almost about to finish. i am in my 7th sem now. i am writing all this so that i dont f*** up like this after college too. i dont want to become that ""loner"" guy that is just there in some corner doing his work like a donkey.

recently, everyone was moving out of hostels to take an accommodation somewhwere outside college. everyone invited and gathered their friend circle of 4-5 people, and shifted in flats and pgs together. and then there's me. as i had absolutely no friends who i could shift with, i am living in college hostel with some fellow loners. 

i can't believe what i have done to myself. maybe i am a bit old school. maybe i have no idea how to make friends in this generation. please please please give me some genuine tips of what should i change about myself so that people around me includes me in their circle and make me an important part of their life. what kind of person do you all like ? how can i also become a person of priority ?",2024-04-18 05:58:38,"['reddit', 'peopl', 'think', 'time', 'help', 'would', 'realli', 'appreci', 'read', 'jolli', 'happi', 'full', 'life', 'mani', 'friend', 'recent', 'class', '10th', 'nice', 'group', 'close', 'friend', 'everyth', 'togeth', 'still', 'contact', 'social', 'differ', 'colleg', 'know', 'feel', 'compani', 'nice', 'friend', '10th', 'start', 'studi', 'competit', 'exam', 'home', 'isol', 'traumat', 'full', 'taunt', 'covid', 'lockdown', 'struck', 'as_wel', 'person', 'come', 'absolut', 'opposit', 'join', 'engin', 'colleg', '2021', 'difficult', 'make', 'friend', 'obvious', 'student', 'differ', 'person', 'could', 'everyon', 'observ', 'everyon', 'tri', 'network', 'a_few', ""wo_n't"", 'work', 'alway', 'close', 'each_oth', 'more_than', 'alway', 'felt', 'ignor', 'uninvit', 'leav', 'self', 'respect', 'asid', 'even', 'tri', 'chang', 'friend', 'group', 'feel', 'like', 'somewher', 'nobodi', 'includ', 'cool', 'like', 'dont', 'drink', 'smoke', 'dont', 'parti', 'club', 'alreadi', 'introvert', '&_amp', 'think', 'two_year', 'isol', 'also', 'becom', 'seriou', 'face', 'bore', 'person', 'peopl', 'relat', 'anymor', 'person', 'peopl', 'around', 'huge', 'friend', 'group', 'alway', 'seen', 'togeth', 'talk', 'laugh', 'watch', 'movi', 'trip', 'girlfriend', 'boyfriend', 'love', ""do_n't"", 'even', 'friend', 'circl', 'becom', 'loner', 'realli', 'want', 'peopl', 'love', 'invit', 'plan', 'want', 'friend', 'treat', 'respect', 'share', 'secret', 'play', 'sport', 'togeth', 'studi', 'togeth', 'dont', 'make', 'feel', 'left', 'joke', 'write', 'colleg', 'almost', 'finish', 'write', 'dont', 'like', 'colleg', 'dont', 'want', 'becom', 'loner', 'corner', 'work', 'like', 'donkey', 'recent', 'everyon', 'move', 'hostel', 'take', 'accommod', 'somewhwer', 'outsid', 'colleg', 'everyon', 'invit', 'gather', 'friend', 'circl', 'peopl', 'shift', 'flat', 'togeth', 'absolut', 'friend', 'could', 'shift', 'live', 'colleg', 'hostel', 'fellow', 'loner', ""ca_n't"", 'believ', 'done', 'mayb', 'school', 'mayb', 'no_idea', 'make', 'friend', 'gener', 'pleas', 'pleas', 'pleas', 'give', 'genuin', 'tip', 'chang', 'peopl', 'around', 'includ', 'circl', 'make', 'import', 'paof', 'life', 'kind_of', 'person', 'like', 'also', 'becom', 'person', 'prioriti']","[(5, 6), (6, 1), (15, 2), (31, 1), (33, 1), (35, 1), (36, 3), (38, 2), (48, 1), (49, 1), (54, 1), (55, 2), (57, 2), (76, 1), (78, 1), (84, 1), (86, 1), (102, 1), (103, 1), (105, 1), (107, 2), (108, 3), (112, 11), (135, 2), (136, 1), (139, 2), (141, 5), (144, 4), (153, 2), (160, 1), (166, 2), (182, 2), (189, 1), (194, 1), (196, 5), (200, 1), (204, 1), (208, 1), (216, 1), (217, 1), (226, 3), (229, 2), (242, 1), (252, 1), (254, 1), (256, 2), (259, 1), (282, 6), (290, 3), (292, 1), (298, 1), (311, 1), (316, 1), (318, 2), (321, 1), (326, 1), (339, 1), (341, 1), (372, 1), (386, 1), (388, 6), (444, 1), (447, 1), (452, 1), (453, 2), (459, 1), (464, 1), (481, 1), (494, 1), (497, 1), (510, 2), (520, 1), (522, 2), (523, 2), (529, 1), (530, 2), (536, 2), (553, 1), (573, 1), (583, 1), (584, 1), (586, 1), (596, 1), (599, 2), (608, 1), (630, 5), (637, 1), (644, 1), (659, 1), (660, 3), (676, 1), (685, 1), (687, 2), (694, 4), (697, 1), (701, 1), (707, 1), (713, 1), (714, 1), (716, 1), (717, 4), (723, 1), (730, 1), (734, 1), (744, 2), (766, 2), (770, 1), (783, 1), (800, 1), (808, 1), (815, 1), (816, 1), (824, 1), (834, 1), (881, 1), (886, 1), (893, 1), (894, 1), (895, 1), (896, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

445,t1_l04lsm1,1713439319.0,"i'm a professor, and i have worked with students on big projects, like a thesis or a conference paper.


my perspective is very different from theirs (and yours). they tend to see their projects sort of like you do -- as this huge thing that says something big about them, personally. it gets tied up with their sense of worth. they are afraid that if someone sees problems with the thesis, it means that they are some sort of fraud.


i don't see it that way at all. i think a thesis is often the biggest project a student has undertaken. they are trying to apply their research skills, and trying to think analytically, and trying to organize a big project -- and all of these are hard. the thesis isn't ""proof that i have everything completely figured out."" it is just a big project that helps you to develop and demonstrate your skills -- even if those skills are still imperfect. 


i see student projects all the time with flaws. (i mean, i see professional projects with flaws, too. including mine.) maybe the organization is not great, or the evidence doesn't point the way that the student thinks it does, or there is a super-relevant article out there that the student hasn't consulted. i see it as my job to guide the student through these problems, not condemn them for having difficulties.


a thesis doesn't have to be a work of staggering genius. the mantra that got me (and all my friends) through grad school was this: ""the best dissertation is a done dissertation."" by working on your thesis, you are learning new things, and that's the point. it doesn't have to be perfect to be worthy. ",2024-04-18 07:21:59,"['professor', 'work', 'student', 'project', 'like', 'thesi', 'confer', 'paper', 'perspect', 'differ', 'tend', 'project', 'soof', 'like', 'huge', 'thing', 'say', 'someth', 'person', 'get', 'tie', 'sens', 'worth', 'afraid', 'someon', 'see', 'problem', 'thesi', 'mean', 'soof', 'fraud', ""do_n't"", 'think', 'thesi', 'often', 'biggest', 'project', 'student', 'undertaken', 'tri', 'appli', 'research', 'skill', 'tri', 'think', 'analyt', 'tri', 'organ', 'project', 'hard', 'thesi', 'proof', 'everyth', 'complet', 'figur', 'project', 'help', 'develop', 'demonstr', 'skill', 'even', 'skill', 'still', 'imperfect', 'student', 'project', 'time', 'flaw', 'mean', 'profession', 'project', 'flaw', 'includ', 'mine', 'mayb', 'organ', 'great', 'evid', ""does_n't"", 'point', 'student', 'think', 'super-relev', 'articl', 'student', 'consult', 'guid', 'student', 'problem', 'condemn', 'difficulti', 'thesi', ""does_n't"", 'work', 'stagger', 'geniu', 'mantra', 'friend', 'grad_school', 'best', 'dissert', 'done', 'dissert', 'work', 'thesi', 'learn', 'thing', 'point', ""does_n't"", 'perfect', 'worthi']","[(14, 1), (15, 1), (33, 6), (35, 1), (45, 1), (55, 3), (74, 1), (84, 1), (107, 1), (109, 1), (112, 1), (121, 2), (135, 3), (138, 1), (149, 1), (154, 1), (179, 2), (186, 2), (194, 1), (196, 2), (203, 1), (222, 3), (229, 3), (235, 1), (259, 1), (282, 1), (311, 1), (318, 1), (326, 1), (338, 1), (402, 2), (407, 1), (416, 1), (417, 1), (437, 1), (469, 1), (471, 1), (487, 1), (501, 1), (510, 1), (528, 1), (533, 2), (558, 1), (576, 2), (605, 1), (653, 1), (655, 1), (710, 1), (732, 1), (776, 1), (792, 1), (863, 3), (893, 1), (903, 1), (904, 1), (905, 7)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

as of right now i am in my second semester of college. last semester i earned two b’s and a c that i am trying to fight a grade appeal on, but haven’t gotten anywhere. this semester i have an a and three c’s, and the end of the semester is literally next week.

this is due to multiple reasons. i work 30+ hours a week along with commuting to school, which doesn’t leave me with much time. i have pretty piss poor time management skills as well, but i think the most impactful part is the fact i have god awful study skills. during grade school i had never needed to study because the material came to me naturally 99% of the time, and thus i never really learned how to study efficiently for exams and such. this has come around to bite me in the ass in college. 

it’s definitely been discouraging, but i am still determined to continue. i have learned a lot of things about myself over these past two semesters that will help a lot in the future. i learned that i lose focus easily and it’s very difficult for me to maintain the same level of focus on a class that lasts the full semester if it’s not stem, so i plan on taking accelerated courses. i am taking a handful over the summer that are easier to manage and plan to use some extra time to study and get better with some algebra/pre cal stuff that i’m rusty on to better prepare for harder classes next semester.

i’m mostly just hoping that college kicking my ass this hard won’t fuck me over too badly in the future. i think i bit off a little bit more than i can chew with how i planned some stuff out previously, but i should be able to fix it/make the best of it. thanks for reading my ted talk.

465,t1_l057rxf,1713448755.0,"i'm kinda in a similar situation, so i'll just tell you what i've personally experienced with it.

so my work-study says that i'm supposed to make about $2,000 a semester. however, i've made a little bit more than that. my job pays $10.50 an hour and i always work the maximum 20 hours a week, meaning that i earn $800 a month and about $3,200 a semester.

from what i understand, when you look at your financial aid and see your work-study offer it's just giving you an estimated amount that you can expect from work-study. realistically everyone will earn a different amount due to different wages and working different hours. the total it shows you isn't the limit, it's trying to show you what you can expect in terms of financial assistance from your work-study.

however, there is still a limit. i don't know what y'all use as your work application but we use something called ""peoplesoft"". that's basically where we clock-in, check our timesheets, stuff like that. on peoplesoft there's a section that goes over the details of your employment and it should say what the limit is that you're allowed to make in one year. for example, mine says that i can earn a maximum of $10,000 a year through work-study, which is very different than the estimate that financial aid gave me 💀

i've made well over what was estimated for me originally. personally, i wouldn't sweat it, but i would definitely check to see if you can find out what your limit is and also check with the financial aid office just to make sure :]",2024-04-18 09:59:15,"['kinda', 'similar', 'situat', 'tell', 'person', 'experienc', 'work-studi', 'say', 'suppos', 'make', '2,000', 'semest', 'howev', 'made', 'littl', 'more_than', 'pay', '10.50', 'hour', 'alway', 'work', 'maximum', 'hour', 'week', 'mean', 'earn', 'month', '3,200', 'semest', 'understand', 'look_at', 'financial_aid', 'work-studi', 'offer', ""it_'"", 'give', 'estim', 'amount', 'expect', 'work-studi', 'realist', 'everyon', 'earn', 'differ', 'amount', 'differ', 'wage', 'work', 'differ', 'hour', 'total', 'show', 'limit', ""it_'"", 'tri', 'show', 'expect', 'term', 'financi', 'assist', 'work-studi', 'howev', 'still', 'limit', ""do_n't"", 'know_what', ""y'all"", 'work', 'applic', 'someth', 'call', 'peoplesoft', 'basic', 'clock-in', 'check', 'timesheet', 'stuff', 'like', 'peoplesoft', 'section', 'goe', 'detail', 'employ', 'limit', ""you_'r"", 'allow', 'make', 'year', 'exampl', 'mine', 'say', 'earn', 'maximum', '10,000', 'year', 'work-studi', 'differ', 'estim', 'financial_aid', 'gave', 'made', 'well', 'estim', 'origin', 'person', 'would', 'sweat', 'would', 'definit', 'check', 'find', 'limit', 'also', 'check', 'financial_aid', 'offic', 'make_sur']","[(10, 3), (37, 2), (42, 1), (46, 1), (52, 1), (55, 1), (57, 1), (69, 1), (74, 2), (75, 2), (77, 1), (84, 1), (110, 1), (117, 1), (127, 1), (128, 1), (132, 1), (134, 1), (135, 3), (136, 2), (144, 2), (149, 1), (152, 2), (160, 1), (165, 1), (172, 3), (176, 2), (177, 1), (179, 1), (181, 1), (195, 2), (196, 1), (204, 1), (246, 1), (253, 1), (255, 2), (258, 2), (259, 1), (260, 1), (261, 3), (282, 2), (290, 1), (318, 4), (320, 1), (322, 1), (347, 2), (374, 1), (392, 1), (420, 1), (429, 1), (450, 3), (469, 1), (517, 1), (525, 1), (539, 1), (556, 1), (587, 1), (626, 1), (634, 1), (694, 1), (748, 1), (773, 1), (774, 1), (874, 1), (919, 1), (920, 1), (921, 4)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

quick question but i have my honors convocation next sunday and have no idea what to wear

im not walking at the actual graduation ceremony as it is on a wednesday and would have to ask family to take off work, as well as myself. (plus it’s like 4 hours long lol)

so i feel that this is a nice alternative, especially as im allowed 4 guests so both my parents and their respective spouses can attend. 

lol, backstory aside, the event requires that we wear our cap and gown. however, i understand that this is not the actual graduation, so is wearing white appropriate? 
or should i opt for a wearing a dress in a different color? 

i have gotten varied responses when looking at websites, but all say that business casual/formal is expected. also have never been to this event before (and none of my friends are attending) so i don’t know the norm either.

this feeling actually just struck me today but it’s really been pestering me and bothering me. 

i’m graduating next month. i don’t have my cap and gown yet. my mom is begging me and berating me for not taking cap and gown pictures, especially considering she doesn’t have an high school ones. i don’t like pictures in the first place, have to pay money to get hair and makeup done for the pictures, etc. i don’t even like this school. i’ve had so much going on in the past month that i’ve barely had time to do anything grad related (im working 2 jobs, and i’m going to my first ever concert for a group i’ve been wanting to see since 2021 in nyc (a first solo trip for me to a whole new city i’ve never been in before), so it’s been really hectic. anyways—back to school.

not to mention i never really made friends here. i don’t have any achievements. i have two measly unpaid internships under my belt. i’ve been ready to graduate to get out of here. but that’s not the only problem. 

after school i thought i knew what i wanted to do. i was going to finish up some prerequisites i needed for a grad school program i wanted to do. get my medical assistant certificate while doing that but i don’t know. i was going to take a break over the summer and get back in the groove in the fall but….i’m not feeling it. it feels like i learned nothing. i feel like im not ready. i don’t want to be real adult. i don’t want to be on my own. i hate that i ruined the supposed best years of my life (i was basically a loser in college and high school). i haven’t even applied for any jobs because i detached myself from school so much other than trying to get good grades (basically running away from my problems) that i’m completely out of the loop for what i’m supposed to do. 

my mom is even throwing me a party and i just don’t think i’m going to enjoy it with this weighing on my mind. what should i do to rid of this feeling? this lowkey ruined the beginning of a “good day”.

4. aim for consistency. try waking up around the same time every day. maybe you wake up at 6:30 on the days where you have the early class and 7:00 when you don’t have it. it will feel easier to wake up if you do it every day, rather than waking up at 6:30 some days and 10:00 other days

518,t1_l05z4vv,1713458170.0,"the r/college thread is littered with students that feel exactly as you do. my advice is to send one of them a private message, it may lead to a worthwhile friendship that would be a bonus if they're at or near your college. 

other things to try: 
*become an ra in your dorm 
*sign up with admissions to be the campus rep/tour guide for transfers
*volunteer somewhere nearby...girls like puppies so it's a good place to start
*find a geekswhodrink trivia night at a bar nearby (you don't have to drink) and ask to join a group ""i'm a transfer student and don't know anyone yet, mind if i join your group?"" you'll probably be invited to join the week after. 
*join an intermural sport: flag football, kickball, sand volleyball, softball. sign up and they put free agents on teams 
*take your work to a coffeeshop...find one with longer community tables that you have to share with someone 
*use your question of what to do in this thread as your reason for approaching people at your college and around you. ""i just transferred here and don't know anyone, have any social things to recommend where i can meet people? it's super isolating not having my friends at school here, someone to grab a meal/drink.."" or just ""you up for a drink/ grabbing food sometime, i just transfered here and don't know anyone yet..?"" you'll be surprised how people might react. invite you along. take the win. initiate something else a week or two later. 
*go to the fitness rec center. workout it will help with endorphins and lift your mood and give you a segway. find someone in your same weight class/fit type and ask if they're interested in being spotting partners/accountability partners/workout buddies to help the other stay motivated because you've always enjoyed fitness more with a partner. 
*and just watch people. if you stop concentrating on how awkward you feel you'll start noticing others that feel the same way. those are your people. approach them. don't try to blend in with the group of friends that have known each other since kindergarten that's an impossible fortress to penetrate.  (#nonewfriends). 
*find/form a meetup to take a walk in the evenings 

my guess is you're trying too hard and being too formal. and maybe you expect to be turned down so you carry yourself with some tension. relax, smile. a  trick i use to meet people easily and anywhere is to act like we're already in the middle of a conversation and shared secret. at a coffeeshop: (to other person also studying) *let out a big sigh then a smile ""ever feel like the more you study the less you know?"" introduce yourself only after talking back and forth a few times almost off-handed.  in class: (to the person next to you) ""he/she (the professor) had me at _____ but lost me at ______. are you able to stick with it all the way through?!!""  and the thing is you look at them when you start the conversation then look back ahead then back at them to punctuate the question mark.  the focus is the conversation and not them. sometimes formalities can seem awkward and transactional. like the end of a conversation always seems weird how to say bye. so just say ""catch ya later or cheers or see you around"" and leave. though i can understand when you feel super isolated you want a friend so bad but you can't force one to start by magic.  it's about making contact over and over until it gives way to something natural.

my advice: start practicing relating to people that you don't fear rejection from.  it's easy to get intimidated by our peers and think they are so much cooler when we feel inadequate, boring, etc. so challenge yourself to strike up conversations with uber drivers, waiters, baristas, people in line, on the bus, etc. who cares if they think you're boring or obnoxious or ridiculous? the point is to practice opening yourself up. so when you do approach people on campus it feels more natural. just ask a random off-handed question ""you seem to know where everything is, how long have you been working here?"" ""what would you recommend?"" ""what name do you get the most? (starbucks barista always writes names)"" ""sorry to bother you, i'm trying to decide between ______ and ______ (movie), have you seen either?"" don't start with your name or hi just throw something out for them to remark on and let it flow. hell volunteer at an old folks home and share some love. they're dying (literally) for conversation and have super cool stories they want to tell before they go and wouldn't judge you in the least as you gain your footing. when your confidence grows then try it on campus. 

and secondly, be genuinely interested in getting to know other people and not just making a friend if that makes sense. when you have an agenda it comes through and is off-putting. forget the end desire and just show interest in others instead of concentrating on who you lack and how you feel. when people feel seen they are more appreciative of you and inclusive and in turn reciprocate by giving attention back. ask them questions about themselves and remark on answers.

538,t3_1c79m4z,1713462437.0,"hello, i'm a music major at a small community college. my focus is voice, and i've been studying it for three years so far. this is where i got my very first voice professor, who i liked a lot at first. but my journey has been slow, and as time went on, she began treating me worse and worse. when it became clear that i wasn't progressing at a desirable rate, at least not compared to my classmates, she started losing faith in me and absolutely did let it show. she's said things to me that have made me want to quit, i've come out of lessons crying. the worst part is, i don't even know if i'm overreacting or not. she's normalized this stuff so much that i've started to think, maybe this is just what voice is like. maybe i just can't take criticism. that's what she's been suggesting, that maybe i can't handle it. i can't trust myself anymore; she's the phd after all, shouldn't she know best? i just want to know if i just can't take criticism, or if there's really something wrong going on here. 
these are some of the things she's told me:
she's told me that i'm not even at a freshman level yet, and that i wouldn't be able to pass an audition. this was this year. she said that even if i did, the school i got into wouldn't let me graduate and would just take my money. she discouraged me from auditioning by saying ""i'd like to tell you that you'd do well in an audition, but i don't want to lie to you."" that one made me give up on applying for auditions and colleges until very recently. before this semester i sent her a friendly email detailing some of the things i was going to do to help me progress, and she sent back five paragraphs about how i shouldn't be in voice, i wouldn't get into a school, and that i haven't been doing the work to improve. even though i stay here for 9 to 10 hours almost every day making sure i get my practice in. she said that at this point, it looks like i'm ""either unwilling or incapable"". and that's just not true, it's the only thing i can be sure isn't true because i'm so willing that i stay until 7 some days. but the fact that i'm still progressing so slowly is making me think, what if she's right that i shouldn't be singing? and what if she was right that i should find another field in music to pursue instead? i get treated like a scapegoat outside of lessons too, which makes me even more discouraged. 
is this really how some professors act? i know there are some hardasses out there, but i feel so conflicted because she's so sweet and harmless on the outside. i never believe anyone when they say i sound good because my teacher says i'm not there yet. today she actually said that i have gotten better, but that it was the first good performance that i've given in a long time.
am i being too sensitive? it's true that i have a long way to go and i'm not as good as i should be by now. but i work really hard, and i wish i could hear some more good things about myself from her every so often. i'm graduating in may so i don't have to endure it much longer, but still...",2024-04-18 13:47:17,"['hello', 'music', 'major', 'small', 'community_colleg', 'focu', 'voic', ""'ve_been"", 'studi', 'three', 'year', 'first', 'voic', 'professor', 'like', 'a_lot', 'first', 'journey', 'has_been', 'slow', 'time', 'went', 'began', 'treat', 'wors', 'wors', 'becam', 'clear', 'progress', 'desir', 'rate', 'at_least', 'compar', 'classmat', 'start', 'lose', 'faith', 'absolut', 'show', 'said', 'thing', 'made', 'want', 'quit', 'come', 'lesson', 'cri', 'worst', 'pai', ""do_n't"", 'even', 'know', 'overreact', 'normal', 'stuff', 'so_much', 'start', 'think', 'mayb', 'voic', 'like', 'mayb', ""ca_n't"", 'take', 'critic', 'suggest', 'mayb', ""ca_n't"", 'handl', ""ca_n't"", 'trust', 'anymor', 'know', 'best', 'want', 'know', ""ca_n't"", 'take', 'critic', 'realli', 'someth', 'wrong', 'go', 'thing', 'told_m', 'told_m', 'even', 'freshman', 'level', 'would', 'be_abl', 'pass', 'audit', 'year', 'said', 'even', 'school', 'would', 'graduat', 'would', 'take', 'money', 'discourag', 'audit', 'say', 'like', 'tell', 'well', 'audit', ""do_n't"", 'want', 'made', 'give', 'appli', 'audit', 'colleg', 'recent', 'semest', 'sent', 'friendli', 'email', 'detail', 'thing', 'go', 'help', 'progress', 'sent', 'back', 'five', 'paragraph', 'voic', 'would', 'school', 'work', 'improv', 'even_though', 'stay', 'hour', 'almost', 'everi', 'make', 'sure', 'practic', 'said', 'point', 'look', 'like', 'either', 'unwil', 'incap', 'true', ""it_'"", 'thing', 'sure', 'true', 'will', 'stay', 'day', 'fact', 'still', 'progress', 'slowli', 'make', 'think', 'right', 'sing', 'right', 'find', 'anoth', 'field', 'music', 'pursu', 'instead', 'treat', 'like', 'scapegoat', 'outsid', 'lesson', 'make', 'even', 'discourag', 'realli', 'professor', 'know', 'hardass', 'feel', 'conflict', 'sweet', 'harmless', 'outsid', 'never', 'believ', 'anyon', 'sound', 'good', 'teacher', 'say', 'today', 'actual', 'said', 'gotten', 'better', 'first', 'good', 'perform', 'given', 'long', 'time', 'sensit', ""it_'"", 'true', 'long', 'good', 'work', 'realli', 'hard', 'wish', 'could', 'hear', 'good', 'thing', 'everi', 'often', 'graduat', ""do_n't"", 'endur', 'much', 'longer', 'still']","[(0, 1), (3, 1), (5, 1), (11, 3), (12, 1), (19, 1), (31, 2), (35, 2), (36, 3), (37, 2), (39, 1), (59, 1), (62, 1), (65, 1), (73, 4), (74, 2), (75, 1), (76, 2), (78, 3), (79, 3), (83, 1), (84, 3), (89, 3), (95, 1), (99, 1), (102, 4), (106, 1), (107, 4), (108, 1), (110, 1), (113, 2), (118, 1), (126, 2), (127, 1), (128, 1), (131, 1), (135, 2), (136, 4), (139, 1), (143, 1), (144, 3), (146, 1), (149, 1), (150, 1), (156, 1), (166, 1), (173, 1), (182, 3), (186, 5), (187, 1), (189, 1), (194, 1), (195, 2), (196, 5), (202, 1), (203, 1), (204, 1), (206, 1), (207, 1), (217, 2), (227, 2), (229, 2), (248, 1), (252, 4), (255, 2), (256, 1), (258, 1), (259, 2), (263, 1), (277, 2), (283, 1), (289, 1), (292, 1), (297, 1), (304, 1), (314, 2), (323, 2), (328, 1), (343, 4), (348, 1), (354, 2), (373, 1), (377, 1), (394, 1), (401, 2), (409, 1), (421, 1), (437, 1), (444, 1), (448, 1), (450, 1), (458, 1), (462, 1), (497, 1), (501, 1), (510, 3), (512, 1), (517, 1), (533, 1), (536, 1), (539, 1), (543, 1), (544, 1), (548, 2), (558, 2), (586, 2), (590, 1), (603, 1), (607, 1), (617, 2), (691, 1), (732, 1), (768, 1), (791, 1), (812, 1), (822, 1), (858, 1), (859, 1), (866, 1), (870, 1), (900, 1), (913, 1), (928, 1), (929, 1), (952, 1), (960, 2), (961, 1), (962, 1)]",[0.00510204 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

none of this sounds like constructive criticism, but it would help to have another expert evaluate what could be going on. its possible you professor is just unreasonably toxic, but you need to find out for sure.

you're putting in a lot of hours practicing- what exactly are you not improving in? is it possible you are practicing the wrong techniques or in the wrong way? do you have deficiencies in skills that would be expected at your level? is there anything physiologically different about your voice which is a barrier? i don't know how common this is, but i went pretty far in classical voice, but my voice itself seemed to have some physiological limitations that capped my potential below the professional level.

if you can find any other voice coach or professor willing to do an evaluation and give you a second option that would be invaluable.

if i were you i'd also ask to sit down with this professor and you get to the bottom of her complaints. make sure you understand specifically what her concerns are, ie what specific things are you lacking. politely tell her that you aren't sure how to interpret statements that you aren't doing work to improve because you are doing x things for y hours a week -- ask what she would recommend doing to improve, and if you could be focusing on the wrong things. i'd also privately ask your classmates about their training routines to see how you compare &amp; make sure you're not just putting in enough hours but that those hours are targeted at the right kind of practice. 

this should give you some sense how reasonable your professors concerns are.

554,t1_l06hztt,1713464424.0,"music school is kinda notorious for abusive and toxic advisor/private lesson relationships. see the movie whiplash for some cathartic stuff. it allowed me some room to be a little more critical of my toxic music school advisor after seeing that movie.

i had a similar experience when i did my undergrad in music performance. the guy i was taking lessons from and advising me had all sorts of lofty ideas for what i would be doing with a music performance degree, but was hilariously out of touch with the current trends in the industry. he was still pushing orchestra auditions and cruise ship gigs as if either were good options that could pay bills or provide a reasonable quality of life, assuming that i even won an audition. which is hilariously competitive, i.e. 100-200 people audition for an single spot, many of which are in there 30s with phds and a decade of daily practice.  
  
if i could redo it, i would change advisors to someone who wasn't so abusive and toxic. there are probably a half a dozen other voice teachers in your school, i would recommend seeing if you can change over to them. you don't deserve to be gaslit and belittled by this voice teacher. 

crying is not normal, but i will be honest that i had similar experiences, and all of the other students in my studio had similar experiences with our professor. none of us deserved his abuse, and it was absolutely not worth the suffering. i could have got a degree piece of paper from pretty much anyone and it would have been worth the same.

your vocal coach sounds like they are withholding praise to get you to work harder and spend more time trying to get better at performing. which... ok... but the reality of the music industry is pretty toxic even if you are an amazing vocalist.

\_\_\_

  
not sure if this helps but here is a timeline of how i ended up spending 4 years of my life in a toxic relationship in music school, still working on recovering via talk therapy now over 10 years later.

freshman year: i placed in all the top ensembles and got a constant stream of compliments and approval from most of my ensemble directors and main advisor.

sophomore year: i placed into even better ensembles but my advisor was starting to get super abusive and nitpicky and a real downer. 

junior year: some grad students showed up in my studio and were indeed better musicians than me, taking the top ensemble spots. advisor became increasingly abusive and i became depressed. realistically i was probably depressed before this...

senior year: advisor handed me off to the grad students for individual lessons, i was pretty mad about it, but they were way less abusive than he was. i stopped participating in the jazz bands as it wasn't required for graduating. i did the bare minimum in all my classes, graduated and moved back in with my parents.

\_\_\_

post graduation, i floundered around and got fired from six jobs within a year, all front line customer service jobs, restaurants, hospitality, call centers, etc. eventually managed to leverage family network into an entry level it job at a public school. lots of talk therapy and group therapy, and improving my it career skills later, i am pretty happy and content and have a lot of things figured out.

you don't deserve to be in an abusive relationship with someone who absolutely does not hold the keys to your future. the music industry is so fucked, that even if you were the best voice student in your program and your vocal teacher was great and you liked them, you still wouldn't end up with a job that pays the bills after doing grad school. well, you might, but i know so many amazing musicians who are destitute, or hustle super hard with all sorts of side jobs to make ends meet. 

if you really want to make it as a vocalist, you need to be in la, nashville, or nyc. thats it, there are no other options. well, i suppose other countries have their equivalents. if you aren't willing to be a starving artist hustling in those extremely expensive places, its probably time to start thinking about what you are going to do with your career, whatever it ends up being. if you can end up with that undergrad degree, change lesson teachers to someone not abusive, and then figure out your early 20s path to a career, it should work out in the end. if your parents are rich though, the rules change, you can probably spend the next 10 years practicing and living in one of the above cities and eventually make it work.

you got this op, and you absolutely don't deserve to be verbally abused.",2024-04-18 14:20:24,"['music', 'school', 'kinda', 'notori', 'abus', 'toxic', 'advisor/priv', 'lesson', 'relationship', 'movi',

so my question is should i just do all the 8 semesters and go at pace so i have more time to do internships and certifications while still in school? i also get more refund back from my scholarship since it will be cheaper to take less credits per semester and i will not have to take summer classes (which is not included in the scholarship).

lab normally ends 1 hour early than scheduled which seemed normal to me (idk i’ve never taken one before this semester) since students never had issues or delays with experiments. so instead of 9-12, we run from 9-11 am.

since the classroom was empty, and lab office hours were prior to the lab, i decided to go to the lecture professor’s office hours which were currently ongoing (the lecture occurs after the lab at 12:30), to see if he’d be able to either receive my homework or pass it on to the lab professor if she’s still on campus… since they both lead the same course.

when i tried to submit my homework to the lecture prof, he made a weird face and asked why i couldn’t just hand it to the lab prof. i told him lab was over and the room was empty. he questioned me on the time i arrived at campus (11:20) and if lab always ended this early. with every answer, his face grew increasingly more… shocked? agitated? i don’t know it felt like i had said something i wasn’t supposed to.

he wanted to travel to the lab professor’s office to “see” if she was there and they both looked surprised to see each other. she was eating / watching something.

since it wasn’t my lab professor’s office hours, i quickly apologized for my actions and handed her my papers hoping to get out of her hair but she seemed out of it the entire time and barely responded.

that whole interaction felt strange, i’m not sure what to make of it. i’ve overlslept before but not by this much so i wouldn’t fault my lab professor for officially disliking me after today for whichever reason.

edit: my lab professor is really nice. i know this incident was out of my control… but had i known she would still be here or where her office was, i would’ve just gone to her directly. is there a way i can redeem myself?",2024-04-18 15:22:33,"['first', 'thing', 'morn', 'today', 'overslept', 'time', 'arriv', 'campu', 'submit', 'homework', 'classroom', 'empti', 'normal', 'end', 'hour', 'earli', 'schedul', 'seem', 'normal', '’_ve', 'never', 'taken', 'semest', 'sinc', 'student', 'never', 'issu', 'delay', 'experi', 'instead', '9-12', '9-11', 'sinc', 'classroom', 'empti', 'office_hour', 'prior', 'decid', 'lectur', 'professor', 'office_hour', 'current', 'ongo', 'lectur', 'occur', '12:30', 'be_abl', 'either', 'receiv', 'homework', 'pass', 'professor', 'still', 'campus…', 'sinc', 'lead', 'the_sam', 'cours', 'tri', 'submit', 'homework', 'lectur', 'prof', 'made', 'weird', 'face', 'ask', 'hand', 'prof.', 'told', 'room', 'empti', 'question', 'time', 'arriv', 'campu', '11:20', 'alway', 'end', 'earli', 'everi', 'answer', 'face', 'grew', 'increasingli', 'more…', 'shock', 'agit', 'don_’', 'know', 'felt', 'like', 'said', 'someth', 'suppos', 'want', 'travel', 'professor', 'offic', 'look', 'surpris', 'each_oth', 'eat', 'watch', 'someth', 'sinc', 'professor', 'office_hour', 'quickli', 'apolog', 'action', 'hand', 'paper', 'hope', 'hair', 'seem', 'entir', 'time', 'bare', 'respond', 'whole', 'interact', 'felt', 'strang', 'not_sur', 'make', '’_ve', 'overlslept', 'much', 'wouldn_’', 'fault', 'professor', 'offici', 'dislik', 'today', 'whichev', 'reason', 'edit', 'professor', 'realli', 'nice', 'know', 'incid', 'control…', 'known', 'would', 'still', 'offic', 'would', '’_ve', 'gone', 'directli', 'redeem']","[(11, 1), (26, 1), (33, 1), (34, 2), (35, 3), (36, 1), (43, 1), (51, 1), (55, 1), (58, 1), (69, 2), (72, 1), (73, 1), (75, 1), (77, 1), (91, 4), (99, 1), (114, 3), (118, 2), (131, 2), (136, 2), (143, 1), (144, 1), (146, 2), (149, 2), (182, 1), (186, 1), (196, 1), (209, 1), (211, 3), (224, 1), (237, 2), (247, 2), (252, 2), (255, 1), (259, 2), (263, 1), (271, 1), (290, 1), (295, 1), (301, 1), (304, 1), (308, 1), (310, 1), (313, 1), (314, 1), (319, 2), (327, 1), (334, 2), (342, 1), (348, 1), (378, 1), (393, 1), (395, 1), (425, 1), (432, 1), (438, 1), (440, 1), (449, 1), (450, 1), (520, 2), (553, 1), (558, 6), (580, 1), (583, 2), (591, 1), (599, 1), (611, 1), (627, 2), (668, 2), (674, 1), (691, 1), (696, 1), (703, 1), (721, 3), (735, 1), (755, 1), (758, 1), (788, 1), (792, 1), (834, 1), (867, 1), (907, 3), (918, 1), (947, 1), (949, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]
594,t1_l06tejm,1713468185.0,"voice major here. i’m lucky to have a great voice professor, but i’ve heard a lot of horror stories, even in my own school. ultimately, you know yourself and your voice best, so i’m not going to tell you what you should do, but here are some perspectives to consider:

1.) if she is not getting anywhere with you, especially after three years in, it’s probably easier for her to blame it on you instead of accepting that her teaching style isn’t working on you and she will likely need to modify her approach with you to see results. some people just need that, and there’s nothing wrong with it. if she’s not willing to tailor your lessons to you, then it might be time to find someone else to teach you - a new professor at the same school, or take a risk and transfer schools!

2.) if you are putting the hours in and practicing as you should be (i.e. not goofing off and playing the piano in the practice room (we all do it 😜)), then the only thing you can do is your best. but, make note of what habits you are actually building into yourself and how you’re practicing. you’re obviously not happy with where you’re at, and neither is your teacher, so maybe try switching some things up in your practice. for starters, please don’t practice more than 2 hours a day maximum. your voice will get tired out, swollen, and you won’t be as productive. i like to do an hour to an hour-and-fifteen at a time. no longer than that. prioritize, do the stuff, then get out of the practice room. rest your voice, take care of yourself, etc. chronically swollen vocal folds from over-practicing can really stunt your growth and progress since your voice is in “survival mode”.

3.) i had a professor one who said some really nasty things to me, and i found out later that it was an attempt to motivate me to be better. try an audition, do something to show her that you’re willing to put in the work. she might be eagerly waiting for you to rise to the challenge and prove her wrong!

4.) the real world is full of people like this - she may just be preparing you for it. i do believe that at the collegiate level, it’s better to be honest with students than to try to sugarcoat everything. she just may be trying to give you a accurate perception of yourself and where you’re at right now. that being said, though, having a growth mindset (instead of a fixed mindset) is the biggest asset you can have in this field. if she’s right and everything she’s saying is true and you know it deep down, the best thing you can do for yourself is to just accept it and move on. it’ll be painful; it’ll make you want to quit. but once you accept the reality of the situation, you’ve officially started the journey to improvement.

5.) on the other hand…if the things she’s saying are blatant lies and you know it, do something about it. report it to someone, record your lessons so you have proof, make a push to switch teachers, whatever you need to do. you won’t be able to grow in an environment that is holding you back. you’re paying for the degree, so get your money’s worth by working with someone who actually wants you to learn.

6.) there could be some miscommunication happening. having a conversation with her if you feel you need it never hurts :) 

those are just some thoughts. i’m sorry you’re dealing with this; it sounds really discouraging and frustrating. best of luck to you on this journey! 🎵🎼🎶🎤",2024-04-18 15:23:05,"['voic', 'major', 'lucki', 'great', 'voic', 'professor', '’_ve', 'heard', 'a_lot', 'horror', 'stori', 'even', 'school', 'ultim', 'know', 'voic', 'best', 'go', 'tell', 'perspect', 'consid', 'get', 'anywher', 'especi', 'three', 'year', 'probabl', 'easier', 'blame', 'instead', 'accept', 'teach', 'style', 'isn_’', 'work', 'like', 'need', 'modifi', 'approach', 'result', 'peopl', 'need', 'noth', 'wrong', 'will', 'tailor', 'lesson', 'might', 'time', 'find', 'someon', 'els', 'teach', 'professor', 'the_sam', 'school', 'take', 'risk', 'transfer', 'school', 'put', 'hour', 'practic', 'goof', 'play', 'piano', 'practic', 'room', 'thing', 'best', 'make', 'note', 'habit', 'actual', 'build', '’_re', 'practic', '’_re', 'obvious', 'happi', '’_re', 'neither', 'teacher', 'mayb', 'switch', 'thing', 'practic', 'starter', 'pleas', 'don_’', 'practic', 'more_than', 'hour', 'maximum', 'voic', 'tire', 'swollen', 'won_’', 'product', 'like', 'hour', 'hour-and-fifteen', 'time', 'longer', 'priorit', 'stuff', 'practic', 'room', 'rest', 'voic', 'take', 'care', 'chronic', 'swollen', 'vocal', 'fold', 'over-pract', 'realli', 'stunt', 'growth', 'progress', 'sinc', 'voic', 'surviv', 'mode', 'professor', 'said', 'realli', 'nasti', 'thing', 'found', 'later', 'attempt', 'motiv', 'better', 'audit', 'someth', 'show', '’_re', 'will', 'work', 'might', 'eagerli', 'wait', 'rise', 'challeng', 'prove', 'wrong', 'real', 'world', 'full', 'peopl', 'like', 'prepar', 'believ', 'collegi', 'level', 'better', 'honest', 'student', 'sugarcoat', 'everyth', 'tri', 'give', 'accur', 'percept', '’_re', 'right_now', 'said', 'though', 'growth', 'mindset', 'instead', 'fix', 'mindset', 'biggest', 'asset', 'field', 'right', 'everyth', 'say', 'true', 'know', 'deep', 'best', 'thing', 'accept', 'move', '’_ll', 'pain', '’_ll', 'make', 'want', 'quit', 'accept', 'realiti', 'situat', '’_ve', 'offici', 'start', 'journey', 'improv', 'hand…if', 'thing', 'say', 'blatant', 'lie', 'know', 'someth', 'repoit', 'someon', 'record', 'lesson', 'proof', 'make', 'push', 'switch', 'teacher', 'whatev', 'need', 'won_’', 'be_abl', 'grow', 'environ', 'hold', 'back', '’_re', 'pay', 'degre', 'money', 'worth', 'work', 'someone_who', 'actual', 'want', 'learn', 'could', 'miscommun', 'happen', 'convers', 'feel', 'need', 'never', 'hurt', 'thought', 'sorri', '’_re', 'deal', 'sound', 'realli', 'discourag', 'frustrat', 'best', 'luck', 'journey', '🎵🎼🎶🎤']","[(0, 1), (19, 1), (27, 1), (31, 3), (33, 1), (35, 2), (36, 2), (37, 1), (39, 1), (52, 1), (55, 1), (59, 1), (68, 4), (73, 2), (74, 2), (76, 1), (78, 2), (79, 1), (80, 1), (89, 1), (90, 1), (91, 1), (92, 1), (99, 1), (107, 1), (108, 1), (110, 1), (111, 1), (113, 1), (118, 1), (120, 1), (127, 1), (128, 1), (129, 1), (130, 1), (135, 3), (139, 1), (144, 3), (149, 2), (150, 2), (154, 1), (160, 1), (171, 3), (181, 1), (182, 3), (183, 1), (186, 5), (196, 3), (204, 1), (211, 2), (221, 1), (226, 1), (227, 1), (235, 1), (252, 3), (258, 1), (269, 1), (271, 1), (278, 1), (283, 2), (284, 1), (285, 1), (287, 7), (298, 1), (300, 1), (304, 2), (307, 1), (310, 1), (325, 1), (326, 2), (329, 2), (360, 1), (373, 1), (377, 2), (380, 2), (388, 2), (397, 1), (407, 1), (410, 2), (412, 1), (424, 1), (437, 4), (440, 2), (444, 1), (446, 1), (448, 1), (450, 3), (458, 2), (461, 1), (487, 1), (495, 2), (506, 1), (510, 1), (512, 1), (528, 2), (531, 1), (543, 1), (558, 3), (575, 1), (588, 1), (590, 2), (595, 1), (596, 1), (621, 1), (638, 1), (640, 1), (641, 1), (652, 1), (654, 2), (657, 1), (706, 1), (708, 1), (727, 1), (741, 1), (750, 1), (766, 1), (770, 1), (776, 1), (791, 6), (795, 1), (808, 1), (814, 1), (818, 1), (822, 2), (826, 1), (870, 1), (878, 1), (903, 1), (912, 1), (922, 1), (924, 1), (928, 1), (937, 1), (942, 1), (962, 1), (969, 1)]",[0.00505051 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

613,t3_1c7clu3,1713469614.0,"hello, for context, i'm 19m at my freshmen year at the university of wyoming, and i have asperger's syndrome-or high functioning autism for short. at our university, we are required to live on the campus dorms for our first year, and in these dorms, they're all shared, so, typically, there's two people generally sharing a room. 

our dorms are built from the sixties, so despite their aesthetic appeal (i love that type of architecture) it makes for a very unattractive living situation, so you can easily hear your neighbours conversation, the elevators are slow and sometimes don't work, and the building seems like it's falling into disrepair. despite this, i generally like my universety, and i'm grateful that my dad worked too pay for my first semester and half of this one (i cover the other half myself.) 

this past semester, i really struggled and failed. i was suicidal for a couple of weeks in october, but during this period i wouldn't really do anything. i would hardly leave the room, and i felt so guilty. even talking about it makes me fairly depressed. however, as a result, i thought that i was a shitty roommate because i hardly left, so this lead me to ""oversee"" many of my roommates behaviour because i thought i would be hypocritical. 

in the past month, i've gotten my act together. i'm going to class, studying, and putting in the work along with trying to balance my part-time job at our dining centre on campus. i want to be a successful student, and i want to learn. it's been years since i've felt this way. i finally don't feel depressed and hopeless. 

well, at least i was... 

a month ago, my roommate started snoring severely during the night. this went on for several nights before i told him that it was happening. he told me his dad has sleep apena (so does mine), so i suggested he gets it checked out. it got so bad i could close the door, and hear him a door or two over still in the hallway. i told him it would help if he could sleep on his front or side, but this wasn't an issue (i didn't make it one rather) because it's not his fault, and i was just trying to let him know that was happening. 

more recently, however, things have gotten worse. as i've tried to pull myself out of this academic hole, it's became more apperant to me how awful and inconsiderate he is as a roommate. for the past four nights, he's kept me up (bare minimum) until 1am. on average, it's nearly 2am until he stops playing video games. now, i don't really have an issue with that-it's his life and consequences at the end of the day; however, when that starts to affect me, it's an issue. as he plays his games, he is always taking to his friends. he laughs, screams, and in general makes noises that keep me up. sometimes, he's woken me up because of this. when i've already fallen asleep. i could be asleep for two hours, and he'll just wake me up. last week, i asked him, politely, if he had any issues with me. he said no. he said i was an ""good"" roommate. additionally, i told him if he has any problems with me, too just let me know about them. he also said that, he tries to be considerate towards me, but i find that statement silly. 

i've been trying to let him know about his behaviour: i told him about this last week, i've slammed the door on him whenever he shows up now, i stay out of the room way more, and i've blocked his ass from all my social media. i only have his phone number until i don't have to live with him anymore. 


he doesn't ever clean up the room, go to classes, never doesn't not cheat on his assigments (dude is a fucking education major), and he talks like he's in the seventh grade. i'm not joking. my grades are starting to slip because of him keeping me up. i missed my fucking classes yesterday, and i've been feeling like shit recently. i miss ya dad ;(

so i have done some searching and haven’t been able to find the proper source that could help me but then i found this thread and i’m hoping someone can point me in the direction that may help my next move towards a biology or geology degree. 

background:

i have a bachelors of fine arts degree in design. obviously, this isn’t applicable to biology and geology. i currently am laid off from my design job and i have realized that i’m not happy where i’m at in my career. i also recently was diagnosed with adhd. i have always been drawn to biology and geology, but because i was younger and undiagnosed, i thought i was too stupid to learn sciences. i want to give my inner child that second chance now that i have the proper resources.  

my areas of interest specifically are plants and fungi. my niche loves are mushrooms, moss, lichen and liverworts. i also have passions for geology; specifically minerals and volcanos. i had looked into geobiology as a focus but based on my research it doesn’t look like a successful career goal as the field is declining unfortunately. 

i am really not sure what i want to focus on, so i figured i will once i start pursuing a degree, with a primary focus on biology and secondary focus on geology. 

it seems like there are colleges that are perfect for biology and some perfect for geology but i am not sure if there are any colleges that are good for both?

i also have an issue with money. i really don’t have the money for college, although i am looking into grants and financing. i am looking into auditing classes, as well as buying all the books i can. since it is april i don’t expect being able to start courses until the fall. i also expect that most deadlines for admissions has passed as well. 

any advice for me based on what i said above would be so helpful. even if it’s to point me in the direction of a specific type of person that could help me like an advisor? 

all i know is that i am made for something more than what i am doing now and my passion for nature and learning how the earth works is motivating me to continue on that path.

thank you for whoever reads this and responds. it means the world.

i would really like to continue music, but i would also like to get a masters in psych after graduating. will getting a bm with a major in psych make it harder to compete for a spot at a top school for psychology? should i just get the ba if i want to be a competitive applicant to top grad schools even if it means not continuing music? im also concerned that if i only major in psychology i’ll miss out on research opportunities.

well since then i always knew i wanted a degree but have no idea in what. i did decide however that nursing doesn't seem like something i can see myself doing.  i currently work in state government doing admin support type of work. so i thought of a business degree since i already have my feet in the door? - but is this really what i want? i don't want to waste my time with a degree that i won't use since i'm 31 already. 

i have two kids now and do not have a spouse our boyfriend. so, i appreciate the m-f work hours to spend time with them on the weekend. 

if i was not a mother what's a dream job that i think about often? a pilot. - but realistically, it doesn't seem possible, especially if i want to be in my kids life. 

anyways, any suggestions are appreciated.

hello, i am just reaching out to apologize for my lack of attendance in the two most recent classes. 

this semester, right around the start of project two i realized i had bitten off a bit more than i could chew credit hour/class-wise. this realization came too late, and in turn, while not necessarily intentional your class unfortunately got placed on the back burner. while i plan on having the final draft submitted on time this sunday (04/21/2024), i am reaching out to ask if i’m still ok to submit the now (extremely) tardy portions that made up the rest of project two. given your already lenient late policy on all assignments, i would entirely understand these submissions not being allowed but figured i would reach out and ask anyway as per the syllabus. 

all in all, i would like to reiterate my apology for the recent lack in my attendance and in general apologize for my recent recurring lack of effort both inside and outside of your class.

i am supposed to finish this semester, then take a couple online summer courses and graduate in august. 

it’s the end of the spring semester and there are two classes that i am just barely passing. i’ve attended almost every single class and get a’s on all the homework’s (writing assignments usually) but i’ve been completely tanking the exams. i have been studying a lot for them and for weeks in advance. i just don’t perform well with tests/exams. i’ve never been good in school so i don’t know why i put myself in this situation. 

if i don’t pass these two classes, i would have to come back next year to take them because they’re in person only (one of them is only offered in the spring). but i’ve reached my financial aid limit and can’t afford to pay out of pocket. i also live with my parents three hours away from the university but my temporary off campus apartment lease is up next month.

now i’ve accumulated 153k in student loan debt and may not even get my degree. if i don’t pass these two classes i will probably give up on it. if i could go back i would never ever go to college.

rank: 2/427

gpa: 4.77/5.0 w, 4.0/4.0 uw

ecs: several leadership positions (nhs, nths, mhs, soccer), marketing internship,  and several other organizations.


so the main question is: should i try reapplying to more schools (through questbridge as well) or spend a year at one of the universities above (i am a finance major and received full rides to 3 of these universities).

&amp;#x200b;

i registered tonight but i was disappointed to discover that i will need an extra semester to complete my degree due to the credits i lost out on when i withdrew from the university. i don't have enough savings to pay for the extra semester and i would like to avoid student loans at all costs. i do not qualify for financial aid and i do not have anyone willing to help me foot the cost.

&amp;#x200b;

i am considering reaching out to the university to explain my situation and possibly ask if the last semester (or the next one) could be discounted due to my withdrawal and circumstances outside of my control. as it is, my transportation was spotty at best during the fall '23 semester, so i did not even attend many of the classes. does anyone have experience with this sort of thing? is it likely that i could get a discounted rate based on the fact that i paid for an entire semester that i could barely attend? i am willing to write a detailed letter to whomever it may concern explaining the situation but i'd rather not waste everyone's time if this is not something that colleges normally do. any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. thanks!",2024-04-18 18:38:04,"['decid', 'take', 'gap_year', 'middl', 'fall', '2023', 'semest', 'reason', 'outsid', 'control', 'lost', 'method', 'transport', 'school', 'halfway', 'semest', 'work', 'professor', 'find', 'altern', 'way', 'attend', 'submit', 'work', 'class', 'littl', 'success', 'fell', 'behind', 'decid', 'full', 'withdraw', 'best', 'option', 'avoid', 'damag', 'decid', 'take', 'gap_year', 'focus_on', 'remot', 'work', 'could', 'afford', 'transpomyself', 'school', 'futur', 'point', 'transport', 'longer', 'concern', 'feel', 'readi', 'go_back', 'school', '&_amp', 'regist', 'tonight', 'disappoint', 'discov', 'need', 'extra', 'semest', 'complet', 'degre', 'credit', 'lost', 'withdrew', 'univers', ""do_n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'extra', 'semest', 'would', 'like', 'avoid', 'student', 'loan', 'cost', 'qualifi', 'financial_aid', 'anyon', 'will', 'help', 'foot', 'cost', '&_amp', 'consid', 'reach', 'univers', 'explain', 'situat', 'possibl', 'last', 'semest', 'next', 'could', 'discount', 'withdraw', 'circumst', 'outsid', 'control', 'transport', 'spotti', 'best', 'fall', 'semest', 'even', 'attend', 'mani', 'class', 'anyon', 'experi', 'soof', 'thing', 'like', 'could', 'discount', 'rate', 'based_on', 'fact', 'paid', 'entir', 'semest', 'could', 'bare', 'attend', 'will', 'write', 'detail', 'letter', 'whomev', 'concern', 'explain', 'situat', 'rather', 'wast', 'everyon', 'time', 'someth', 'colleg', 'normal', 'advic', 'would', 'greatli', 'appreci', 'thank']","[(5, 1), (10, 1), (23, 1), (30, 1), (31, 3), (33, 1), (34, 1), (35, 1), (39, 1), (41, 3), (52, 2), (61, 2), (68, 1), (75, 7), (78, 2), (84, 1), (86, 1), (88, 1), (94, 2), (97, 1), (103, 2), (107, 1), (108, 1), (110, 1), (135, 3), (136, 2), (138, 1), (139, 4), (146, 1), (147, 1), (149, 1), (155, 1), (159, 1), (164, 1), (186, 1), (194, 1), (196, 2), (201, 1), (202, 2), (209, 1), (217, 2), (223, 1), (242, 2), (248, 1), (253, 1), (268, 1), (273, 2), (276, 1), (279, 2), (280, 1), (284, 1), (333, 1), (342, 1), (367, 1), (370, 2), (376, 1), (387, 1), (411, 1), (434, 2), (435, 2), (437, 2), (438, 3), (446, 1), (452, 1), (455, 1), (458, 2), (462, 1), (465, 1), (500, 1), (509, 1), (513, 1), (530, 1), (533, 1), (539, 1), (558, 1), (559, 1), (576, 1), (581, 2), (601, 1), (694, 1), (696, 1), (725, 1), (757, 2), (766, 1), (804, 1), (830, 1), (883, 2), (897, 1), (918, 1), (987, 2)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

i'm 21(f) from brazil, and i'm currently struggling with ""the early twenties crisis"". last year i enrolled in an online religious studies course at a private college (my only option since i live in the countryside and currently can't move to a big city). due to personal reasons, i took a break but now i'm looking forward to coming back because i'm sure i've found my passion; the classes are awesome and i love everything about it. the problem is, i started to get kinda worried about what are my options after finishing college. i've asked a professor, and he told me that i could be a teacher (i'd be really happy, but the salary is not that great, and life quality is a big priority to me because i want to support my family. also, i don't know if being a religious studies professor would be that easy here in brazil, probably due to lack of opportunities) or a researcher. this second option caught my attention, but i don't properly know how it works. any researchers here to help? how did you guys get a job? is it worth it? i know life is not all about money, but we need it to live with dignity, and i'm currently considering a big change and getting a pharmacy degree (doesn't suit me at all but is easier to make money, and also easier to make me depressed for giving up my dreams, haha :c). i don't wanna give up but i also don't wanna be underpaid. please help me with some advice, especially if you work with religious studies. i just want to live comfortably doing something that i love.",2024-04-18 19:28:05,"['everyon', 'brazil', 'current', 'struggl', 'earli', 'twenti', 'crisi', 'last', 'year', 'enrol', 'onlin', 'religi', 'studi', 'cours', 'privat', 'colleg', 'option', 'sinc', 'live', 'countrysid', 'current', ""ca_n't"", 'move', 'citi', 'person', 'reason', 'took', 'break', 'look', 'forward', 'come', 'back', 'sure', 'found', 'passion', 'class', 'awesom', 'love', 'everyth', 'problem', 'start', 'kinda', 'worri', 'option', 'finish', 'colleg', 'ask', 'professor', 'told_m', 'could', 'teacher', 'realli', 'happi', 'salari', 'great', 'life', 'qualiti', 'prioriti', 'want', 'suppomi', 'famili', 'also', ""do_n't"", 'know', 'religi', 'studi', 'professor', 'would', 'easi', 'brazil', 'probabl', 'lack', 'opportun', 'research', 'second', 'option', 'caught', 'attent', ""do_n't"", 'properli', 'know', 'work', 'research', 'help', 'guy', 'worth', 'know', 'life', 'money', 'need', 'live', 'digniti', 'current', 'consid', 'chang', 'get', 'pharmaci', 'degre', ""does_n't"", 'suit', 'easier', 'make', 'money', 'also', 'easier', 'make', 'depress', 'give', 'dream', 'haha', ""do_n't"", 'wan_na', 'give', 'also', ""do_n't"", 'wan_na', 'underpaid', 'pleas', 'help', 'advic', 'especi', 'work', 'religi', 'studi', 'want', 'live', 'comfort', 'someth', 'love']","[(5, 2), (19, 2), (23, 3), (36, 2), (37, 1), (38, 1), (43, 3), (57, 3), (58, 1), (59, 1), (60, 1), (68, 1), (76, 1), (80, 2), (84, 4), (91, 1), (102, 1), (103, 1), (104, 1), (111, 1), (120, 1), (121, 1), (135, 2), (136, 1), (139, 1), (142, 1), (143, 1), (144, 2), (149, 1), (154, 1), (155, 1), (166, 3), (182, 1), (194, 2), (201, 1), (204, 2), (209, 1), (222, 1), (226, 1), (231, 1), (236, 1), (252, 3), (254, 3), (282, 1), (284, 1), (292, 1), (298, 1), (323, 1), (326, 1), (334, 1), (378, 1), (399, 1), (407, 1), (427, 1), (433, 2), (446, 1), (447, 1), (460, 1), (471, 2), (487, 1), (515, 1), (522, 2), (523, 2), (549, 1), (558, 2), (567, 1), (588, 1), (590, 1), (617, 1), (634, 1), (642, 1), (694, 1), (719, 1), (728, 1), (736, 1), (746, 1), (808, 1), (811, 1), (836, 1), (906, 1), (944, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

i wasn't like that, i was a hardworking student but last semester i realised i hate what i'm studying and i even hate the jobs related. it's weird because i've never liked studying since high school and i knew it. i know i don't like biology since my 1st year of college but i'm realising it just this year(it's weird). i chose to go to college and study science because i had no choice no options. my parents said since i'm a kid that i'll go to college and work in a science field. it was an affirmation not an option. so i studied those years with a weird mindset that i don't even understand or remember. my last mindset : i study hard to get good grades, i have to pass the years. if i pass one semester of college then i'll pass the other one. i'll do that until it ends.

i've spent my life doing things i hate thinking that once i finish school and college i'll finally have the right to live my life as i want. the thing is that mindset doesn't work anymore, i'm too aware of the hartred i have towards college.

i want to finish this semester and graduate because i want to at least receive a diploma to compensate all the time i wasted. i also fear what my family will think about me but also what i will think about myself. the problem is that the diploma is useless because in my country i need to do 5 years in total to get a job in my field, so i have 2 years left.

this morning i cried in my bed for hours because i have to prepare 2 oral presentations plus 2 group projects for this week. i just wish i could sleep and never wake up again.

i just need to get things done but i can't bring myself to study. i'm pulling overnights just to procrastinate and end up rushing the work. can anyone help me ?

i guess i’m writing here for the first time cause i’m anxious over the results of the 2nd test. we aren’t getting our results till tommorow and everyone was thinking they did good and i’m not sure the same.  i’ve woken up anxious every morning as to whether i’ll get a c or better in this class (passing grade for major prereqs). 

how that connects to the group project is for this class, the test averages are traditionally in the 60’s but they curves the grading scale based on class average. this could mean if the class got an 86 average or something, that would be a b- so if you get lower than class average regardless, you are getting a c+ or lower. 

everyone tries to do good on the project instead of the tests but i don’t think our group project will be good enough since their grading criteria is very strict so i’m nervous about that. i guess i’m just nervous about my grade and need a little encouragement. thank you to everyone who reads this and responds! also i don’t know how flairs work here hopefully i used it correctly .

i would say, daydream a bit...like when you were a small child. what makes you smile when you think of yourself in that role. do you see yourself lecturing college students? would you want to run your own lab? are you a scientist at heart? medical school? consider taking an interest inventory. google some and see what you come up with. or, more than likely there is an office on campus, already setup to help students complete interest inventories.

don't even feel tied to biology. so what if you didn't choose a minor. graduate school is still a possibility, if you decide it's necessary. the courses you'll need are simply the prerequisites.

i have been an assistant teacher since january 8th. i began working on july 31st, 2023. i have been told in the past that i can make more money at my job (i make $17 an hour) if i complete child development courses - i presently have an a in my child development course, will drop to a b at lowest potentially depending on how the next month goes, and am taking the introductory child development course. i also am signed up for one in fall. the only other college course i have found to pique my interest is my introduction to psychology course, and i’m signed up for another in the fall. in my area, to make good money as someone who was working in the field of psychology, you need to attain a masters degree. i attend community college and graduated in june 2023, i actually do feel like i’m improving at my job even though i’m not perfect and i’ll be working in summer as well. i should have over $11000 saved by the time i’m paid at the end of this month, as i never spend my money and have been working more often since i became an assistant. i do enjoy working with the kids, even though some days are more challenging than others. 

since the child development courses are not at my home college, it will realistically take me more time to complete them (as i tend to only sign up for the ones that are offered as online courses.)

no, that is reasonable for a bsn.

bsns even in shithole rural areas at shithole facilities make at least 18-20 straight grad which is 40k. but that is absolute garbage tier worst case and you will either do better or work that for several months and move on and do better. more likely 50-80k. some overpriced, overhyped place like ny/ca 100-180k. even absolute trash tier, you will still make double your investment in 1 year. which is more than what most programs can claim.

bear in mind, though, that nursing school is boot camp and flunks out people and they tell people straight up you can't work and do this. (at least last two years). so have a support network or live cheap/dorms.

you would  be able to save a bit on that and go to a community college for adn (1 semester prereqs, 2 yrs ns) then bridge. going to work in 2 years and making same amount.  but the community colleges are actually much tougher and much more selective than the 4 years. not all of them have dorms, though, if you need a roof doing this. also, those programs have long wait lists because of what they offer. a 2 year ticket to the middle class.

adns and rns start out making the same, but advancement into management or the cooler, much higher paying stuff they prefer/ is locked behind  bsn and/or other certs and degrees.

speaking of waiting list, there's also logistics. i knew people who had to pay more or travel distances because of waitlists. one person i knew even had to go to school in another state then repricocity back. if kennesaw state has accepted you, in some cases, your choice may be made (that is, if you want nursing) as people know about it and stampede the programs as it had the reputation as a ""for sure, okay paying job"". but do realize that it entails a lifestyle of constant drug tests, zero criminal records, careful with social media, shift work, and there is no ""nursing shortage"" in many areas, only a shortage of people willing to wipe poo (bedside).",2024-04-18 22:49:27,"['former', 'look', 'nurs', 'nope', 'reason', 'bsn', 'even', 'shithol', 'rural', 'area', 'shithol', 'facil', 'make', 'at_least', '18-20', 'straight', 'grad', 'absolut', 'garbag', 'tier', 'worst', 'case', 'either', 'better', 'work', 'sever', 'month', 'move', 'better', 'like', '50-80k', 'overpr', 'overhyp', 'place', 'like', 'ny/ca', '100-180k', 'even', 'absolut', 'trash', 'tier', 'still', 'make', 'doubl', 'invest', 'year', 'more_than', 'program', 'claim', 'bear', 'mind', 'though', 'nurs', 'school', 'boot', 'camp', 'flunk', 'peopl', 'tell', 'peopl', 'straight', ""ca_n't"", 'work', 'at_least', 'last', 'two_year', 'supponetwork', 'live', 'cheap/dorm', 'would', 'be_abl', 'save', 'community_colleg', 'semest', 'prereq', 'bridg', 'go', 'work', 'year', 'make', 'amount', 'commun', 'colleg', 'actual', 'much', 'tougher', 'much', 'select', '4_year', 'dorm', 'though', 'need', 'roof', 'also', 'program', 'long', 'wait', 'list', 'offer', 'year', 'ticket', 'middl', 'class', 'adn', 'staout', 'make', 'the_sam', 'advanc', 'manag', 'cooler', 'much', 'higher', 'pay', 'stuff', 'prefer/', 'lock', 'behind', 'and/or', 'cert', 'degre', 'speak', 'wait', 'list', 'also', 'logist', 'knew', 'people_who', 'travel', 'distanc', 'waitlist', 'person', 'knew', 'even', 'school', 'anoth', 'state', 'repricoc', 'back', 'kennesaw', 'state', 'accept', 'case', 'choic', 'made', 'want', 'nurs', 'peopl', 'know', 'stamped', 'program', 'reput', 'sure', 'okay', 'pay', 'realiz', 'entail', 'lifestyl', 'constant', 'drug', 'test', 'zero', 'crimin', 'record', 'care', 'social', 'media', 'shift', 'work', 'nurs', 'shortag', 'mani', 'area', 'shortag', 'peopl', 'will', 'wipe', 'bedsid']","[(5, 1), (27, 1), (30, 1), (31, 2), (32, 2), (36, 1), (37, 3), (53, 2), (57, 2), (59, 1), (68, 1), (75, 1), (83, 1), (85, 2), (86, 1), (99, 1), (102, 1), (103, 1), (107, 3), (113, 1), (117, 1), (122, 1), (125, 1), (127, 1), (128, 1), (129, 2), (135, 4), (136, 1), (143, 1), (144, 4), (152, 1), (155, 1), (160, 1), (167, 1), (171, 1), (178, 2), (181, 2), (196, 2), (197, 1), (206, 1), (209, 1), (221, 1), (225, 1), (252, 1), (254, 1), (255, 1), (259, 1), (263, 3), (267, 2), (271, 1), (278, 2), (282, 1), (283, 1), (298, 1), (305, 1), (317, 1), (336, 1), (339, 1), (350, 1), (365, 3), (377, 2), (388, 4), (439, 1), (446, 1), (458, 1), (467, 1), (491, 1), (494, 1), (532, 1), (536, 2), (548, 1), (556, 1), (569, 1), (603, 2), (617, 1), (648, 2), (661, 1), (690, 1), (691, 1), (735, 1), (744, 1), (780, 1), (790, 4), (804, 1), (825, 1), (859, 1), (876, 1), (897, 1), (901, 1), (993, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

i'm a fifth-year senior at a major state university and i've noticed substantial changes in the faculty following the pandemic in my department. it's beginning to take a large emotional toll on me and i've been considering the value of education following this realization. 

i've had numerous professors within the last 2-3 years arrive to classes late, add additional coursework to an already established syllabus, cancel numerous classes that often result in 1-2 weeks of no class time, professors who cancel class for personal or professional trips, or display a general lack of respect for students. these things feel as if they come at the expense of my education. literally and figuratively. 

i must note: student behavior has changed, too. and in ways i don't feel i must make explicit-- we're all students who directly face the strenuous college lifestyle. perhaps this is attributing to these changes?

besides covid-19 and the lack of student engagement, i cannot find a solid ""answer"" to these cultural shifts on campus. additionally, i'm struggling to recognize if this is an isolated change at my college. i understand professors are people, too. i'm not attempting to shame nor interrogate professors. instead, i'm curious in how and/or why these cultural shifts surrounding college etiquette and expectations have changed.

honestly, i'm just confused.

so, i get plagiarism—stealing others' ideas, not giving credits, etc. but, in the case of a group project where each person *also* ends up writing their *own* paper... does discussing things count as plagiarizing because it's related to each others' ideas?

basically, i'm in a group of three people and we're doing a chemistry experiment together, and then we're each going to write our own individual papers. my question is, would discussing the results of our experiment and discussing potential ideas for the discussion section be plagiarism? and i don't mean like ""hey, look, this is what i wrote for the discussion!""—i mean, like, just talking about it; like discussing potential conclusions or limitations to our experiment, for example.

i hope this makes sense (and that i also posted this in the right sub). i'm honestly just confused and i don't want to get in trouble by accidentally plagiarizing or something.

791,t3_1c7n7jf,1713498192.0,"here's a little backstory, i graduated high school with a 3.9 gpa, which would have been higher if i had not messed around freshman year. i got back on track and took on several leadership roles in clubs and on sports teams during high school. my siblings all went to extremely respected universities, and are all very successful in their careers. my parents never really thought college was for me, but they still pushed me towards going, and have taken it upon themselves to help their youngest child(me), with some of the financial costs of college. i had no idea what i wanted to do after college, or even what i wanted to study, but i went in hopes i would figure those things out.

my freshman year was a great year for me, i ended up making deans list and was active in student government and a coed business fraternity. the issues i faced that year came from my unhappiness with my choice in the university i attended, the social group i found myself in, and the degree i chose. i decided to stick with the university and i changed degrees to something i thought i would enjoy more, but this is where things took a turn for me. sophomore year had several issues arise, one being an extremely toxic relationship with a partner that was both physically and mentally abusive, and my grandfather fell ill suddenly and passed after a month or so of battling the disease. i was taking mostly online classes at that time, and i was the only grandchild who was physically capable of being there, so i decided to stay at home for a month or so while he was sick. my grades took a turn, and the problems i faced prior to my grandfathers illness persisted. so once the semester was coming to a close, i decided to transfer to another school.

the school i chose was one i knew very well. it was about 30 minutes from my home, i spent a lot of time in the town the school was in, and i knew some people who went there from high school. it seemed at first the perfect school for me, there was a great music scene, which i appreciated because i had wanted to start a band for a long time. the area was gorgeous, and i was already familiar with the area. once i got to this school i faced severe depression due to the isolation i felt in the beginning. i had left the social group i spent two years getting to know, and anyone who transfers can attest to how scary it is to leave what you had behind for something new. my grades suffered due to my depression, but i did well overall. however, one class that absolutely tanked my gpa was one i did all the work for, and had an a in the class until my professor dropped me down to a c over my final paper. there were no explanations, no corrections, and when asked to discuss it, they never responded. spring semester came around and i am by far at my lowest ever. more family issues arose, that took a lot of my time away from studies. i found a job to make ends meet with rent and necessities, but in order to make enough i had to work more than i should have. i contracted pneumonia about 2 weeks into the semester, and that took me away from class for about 3-4 weeks.

i don't want to make this a pity party for myself, i have some other issues that came about but are not worth mentioning due to the length of this post. i also fully acknowledge life is hard, and you either rise to the occasion or fall short when the pressure is too much. i am here to simply ask for some advice, the semester is about 3 weeks away from being over, and i can already say i will either fail one or two of my classes, and there's no ability to drop them. one professor offered to take some late assignments, but i don't think they will bring me to a passing grade. another professor never responded to any of my emails over the semester, so i have completely given up on that class. i am at a very high chance of being on academic probation, and i have lost all confidence and hope in myself to bounce back. 

this is a lot, and i apologize in advance, but i don't know what to do. i can't drop out, i can't take a semester off, and i just don't know what to do. anyone who has had similar experience in college, our made the comeback, how did you do it? anyone who can provide insight, it is greatly appreciated. i know some of this sounds hard to believe, but i assure you this is as honest of a retelling as it possibly can be without becoming a whole biography. im lost, and i would love advice more than you could possibly know.

some are less defensible than others. like, chronic lateness for no reason is bad. on the other hand, i wouldn't think twice about minor changes or additions to the syllabus, though i do think major changes should be avoided if possible. 


canceling classes for professional trips is pretty much unavoidable -- if professors want to get tenure or get promoted, they have to present their work at professional conferences, and that means travel during the academic year. (nowadays, a professor might post a lecture on canvas or something, but that sort of thing didn't exist back then.)

812,t1_l095rq8,1713501919.0,"i am a teacher, so i may be able to give you some insight.

i want to start by saying that it sounds like you got hit with a lot in a very short period of time, and that is always very difficult. anxiety and depression often follow major life changes like the ones you described, so i am not terribly surprised that you are experiencing those feelings right now. the hardest part is, when you start to lose, you lose momentum - and then things get worse - and then we start making prophecies of our own failure and inadvertently fulfill them.

with all that being said, take stock of where you are, not where you fear you are. 

***with the first professor, hand in the missing assignments with as high a quality as you can***. even if you do not pass, it will be worth salvaging your grade to the best of your ability. as a teacher, i can tell you that i am far more likely to pass a student if they make the effort in the end than if they give up entirely.

***with the professor who is not responding to email, i would suggest figuring out what their office hours are and showing up in person.*** don't mention the emails unless they ask something to the effect of ""why haven't you contacted me?"" your main goal is to convey that you want to make the most of your remaining time in their class and learn as much as you can - that you are sorry that you missed as much content as you did. if they asked why you weren't there, give them the short version and take ownership of what you could have done - but don't beat yourself up. even if they don't pass you, use this as a learning opportunity and make the most of the time you have left there.

both of these things are difficult, but necessary. it will set you on the right foot for next semester - rather than getting into the cycle of running away - which is common for students who are in a tough spot. i was one of those students too.

i know your pain when it comes to finding yourself without your friend group, and changing to a campus where few, if any people know you. i also experienced problems with my major and my friend groups too. all of that sucks. i didn't have an abusive relationship, but my long time girlfriend dumped me just before i got into my last semester of my senior year. it sent me into a tailspin of depression. this was all a long time ago for me - but i haven't forgotten.

if i could have done it again, i would have focused on mastering myself first. when i stopped trying to worry and started trying to work, i noticed that i eventually outran the things that were plaguing me. when i finally started getting proactive instead of reactive, then i felt like i had mastered my situation. i figured that out rather late (in the second half of my master's degree) but it had a profound impact on the quality of my work and my quality of life.",2024-04-19 00:45:19,"['teacher', 'be_abl', 'give', 'insight', 'want', 'stabi', 'say', 'sounds_lik', 'a_lot', 'shoperiod', 'time', 'alway', 'difficult', 'anxieti', 'depress', 'often', 'follow', 'major', 'life', 'chang', 'like', 'one', 'describ', 'terribl', 'surpris', 'experienc', 'feel', 'right_now', 'hardest', 'pai', 'stato', 'lose', 'lose', 'momentum', 'thing', 'wors', 'stamak', 'propheci', 'failur', 'inadvert', 'fulfil', 'said', 'take', 'stock', 'fear', 'first', 'professor', 'hand', 'miss', 'assign', 'high', 'qualiti', 'even', 'pass', 'worth', 'salvag', 'grade', 'best', 'abil', 'teacher', 'tell', 'like', 'pass', 'student', 'make', 'effoin', 'give', 'entir', 'professor', 'respond', 'email', 'would', 'suggest', 'figur', 'office_hour', 'show', 'person', ""do_n't"", 'mention', 'email', 'unless', 'someth', 'effect', 'contact', 'main', 'goal', 'convey', 'want', 'make', 'remain', 'time', 'class', 'learn', 'much', 'sorri', 'miss', 'much', 'content', 'ask', 'give', 'shovers', 'take', 'ownership', 'could', 'done', ""do_n't"", 'beat', 'even', ""do_n't"", 'pass', 'learn', 'opportun', 'make', 'time', 'left', 'thing', 'difficult', 'necessari', 'right', 'foot', 'next', 'semest', 'rather', 'get', 'cycl', 'run', 'away', 'common', 'student', 'tough', 'spot', 'student', 'know', 'pain', 'come', 'find', 'without', 'friend', 'group', 'chang', 'campu', 'peopl', 'know', 'also', 'experienc', 'problem', 'major', 'friend', 'group', 'suck', ""did_n't"", 'abus', 'relationship', 'long', 'time', 'girlfriend', 'dump', 'last', 'semest', 'senior', 'year', 'sent', 'tailspin', 'depress', 'long', 'time', 'forgotten', 'could', 'done', 'would', 'focus', 'master', 'first', 'stop', 'tri', 'worri', 'start', 'tri', 'work', 'notic', 'eventu', 'outran', 'thing', 'plagu', 'final', 'start', 'get', 'proactiv', 'instead', 'reactiv', 'felt', 'like', 'master', 'situat', 'figur', 'rather', 'late', 'second', 'half', 'master', 'degre', 'profound', 'impact', 'qualiti', 'work', 'qualiti', 'life']","[(0, 1), (6, 1), (11, 2), (21, 1), (33, 3), (35, 5), (36, 2), (37, 1), (38, 2), (52, 1), (55, 2), (57, 1), (58, 1), (66, 1), (73, 1), (74, 1), (75, 2), (76, 2), (78, 2), (84, 3), (88, 1), (99, 1), (103, 1), (104, 2), (105, 2), (106, 2), (107, 2), (108, 1), (109, 2), (110, 1), (112, 2), (119, 1), (121, 1), (128, 1), (135, 2), (136, 2), (139, 2), (144, 3), (149, 1), (154, 2), (155, 1), (183, 1), (186, 3), (188, 1), (196, 3), (204, 3), (227, 1), (231, 1), (235, 2), (247, 1), (249, 1), (252, 2), (257, 1), (258, 1), (263, 2), (277, 1), (281, 1), (282, 1), (288, 1), (290, 1), (292, 1), (304, 1), (311, 2), (325, 1), (348, 3), (359, 1), (361, 2), (372, 1), (373, 2), (384, 1), (385, 1), (388, 1), (399, 1), (400, 1), (401, 1), (407, 1), (409, 2), (425, 1), (437, 1), (446, 1), (456, 1), (466, 1), (502, 1), (520, 1), (522, 2), (548, 2), (551, 1), (558, 2), (574, 1), (579, 1), (590, 2), (601, 2), (602, 1), (604, 1), (607, 1), (612, 1), (627, 1), (629, 1), (642, 1), (643, 1), (660, 2), (669, 1), (670, 1), (698, 1), (702, 1), (732, 1), (746, 3), (748, 2), (753, 1), (781, 1), (797, 3), (802, 1), (864, 1), (872, 1), (877, 1), (889, 1), (907, 1), (918, 1), (936, 1), (949, 1), (963, 1), (971, 1)]",[0.00571429 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

unfortunately, it's complicated and perpetuating series of historical happenings... i'm oversimplifying/generalizing here, and it's likely tldr.

going to college was once a sign of accomplishment/affluence. 

almost all parents yearned for their kids to go to college to better themselves and land better jobs.

for a while it was basically guaranteed that going to college would get you paid more.

more people went to college. higher ed industry grew. you start to see more for-profit colleges with easier access and bigger promises. 

more colleges fighting for students to buy in. standards lowered. entry is easier. finding money to go gets easier, but more devious.

parents expect their kids to go to college as a normal occurrence. many students feel they have to go. higher ed gets saturated and financially prosperous. 

having a college degree isn't special in the workplace anymore. harder for recent grads to stand out in a crowded job market. 

big economic crash.

recently graduated students start to realize that all that free money wasn't actually free. crippling debt on top of economic downturn. 

major life events postponed - buying a home, having kids...

the debt and impact on lives causes people to question the value of education.  is it worth all the debt and despair?

higher ed industry sees the questioning and doubles down on making college easier to get into by further lowering standards both to get in and to stay in. 

for many educators, academic rigor is forcibly replaced by the ""customer is always right"" academia, fueled by bottom lines.

the value of higher ed is questioned even more due to even lower standards and further economic problems. 

online education grows as a cheaper alternative to residential education. many start to see this as the better choice. you start to see questionable value, online-only, take your money and run colleges pop up.

value questioned even more.

big problem incoming. in no small part due to economic downturn, people are having fewer children. this translates into fewer college-age students available. that cliff is coming. 

colleges need to pivot to being even more accessible to start relevant and competitive in the saturated market. ""everything's flexible and negotiable"" in higher education. we need to cater to our customer's needs and wants.

pandemic hits. shit gets real. it affects us horribly. all of us, students, staff, faculty... life gets really hard for a lot of people.

pandemic forcibly accelerates online education on colleges. do or die. academics now cater to the individual needs of each student. ultimate flexibility and unrestricted ""understanding"" becomes the norm. 

we're all going through some stuff. everyone - rightfully so - tries to take it easier on each other. everyone gets an a because of the situation.

we got used to netflix, doordash, zoom... never leaving the house but having everything on-demand. consume. i bet i can be a content creator. look it up on youtube.  what do i even need college for?

we all physically come back from the time away, but some of us never truly come back. we like it easier. we still got graded/paid the same for doing less. i don't want to go to work. can't i just...

post-pandemic, the economy changed. things are more expensive. 

but we still want it our way, immediately, and as cheaply as possible.

higher ed has a money problem. no one wants to pay sticker prices for college. more financial aid! make entry simpler. cater! pander! satisfy! retain!

education, served like burger king: have it your way. give them what they want when they want it. do it all, now. yesterday. anticipate every individuals' needs. give them everything you have, day and night.

but cut costs everywhere.  resources dwindling. incoming classes are smaller. is the ship sinking? faculty leaving for higher-paying jobs. 

admin not replacing them to lower the budgets. spread the work around to the rats left on the ship. oh but there's no additional pay. no, we can't do raises this year. for the good of the cause!

faculty: what am i doing?

student: why should i care? 

staff: please don't fire me. 

parent: why does my child have an f?

administration: what can we do to pass this student?

and now here we are. education is kinda fucked up. 

it's a product of us. we did this.

there are a lot of good, honest, passionate, hard-working people on every side of this - students, staff, faculty, admin. great people that actively resist the generalizations i put forth here. 

but there's so many who have given in to bottom-line, basic, burger king education.  for some, it's the only way they survive. for others, it's just easier.

i'm not sure how we figure this one out, if we do. maybe it needs time. maybe better economics. but here's where we are.",2024-04-19 00:54:22,"['prof', 'unfortun', ""it_'"", 'complic', 'perpetu',

as such, i'm not confident in my abilities so i'm not looking forward to getting my first job (i've been on the doll). i will have like 30k in hecs, and 25k in the bank by graduation, which i'm at a crossroads of putting into hisa or etfs but that isn't the point of this post.

i also have had been amazed by stuff like chatgpt, i've kept up with all of the research and developments. it's been a light in the tunnel, but also a dark one, for someone like me who isn't smart. dark in the sense that if i take a gap year, i'm almost sure ill come back to systems which are nearing the point of making me obsolete in the work force. it might not be there yet but its semantics at that point, it'll happen in the next year or two if it isn't.

however, it is also amazing because it can then help me to create all the ideas i have, and i could be some baby enterpreneur. i would love if it worked out like this and i could finance it.

and i havent really gotten to travel. i've been told if i travel after graduating it'll be harder for me to find a job afterwards. this is concerning because i'm already not confident in finding a job. and my friends and family will keep asking me what i'm doing and i just hate that, i just want to be left alone. and i genuinely think i'll only get to work a couple of years before ai makes me pointless in the workforce. it sounds nice for me to travel for x months and come back to a different reality where i can see where my skills may be needed elsewhere. as for my travelling, i'm not sure where i'd go yet, but i'd love to backpack solo and travel on the cheapest of shoestrings. by working while i'm overseas (even though i've never worked before) and couch surfing, or pet sitting, or sleeping in a hamac, id hopefully limit costs so that i won't be taking $ out of the bank. also not sure how long i could go for but the more the merrier i say? i'll practice it in australia before before going overseas.

and most importantly, expectations of my future and my wants/needs:

i do not care to have a family, i do not care for a house, i'd much rather a hotel next to public transit in a walkable city. i don't have a car and i don't plan on getting one (i have my license but i just hate driving so i don't). i really hate the rat race of society which is likely why ive not worked a day in my life or done too well at uni. how i've been treated while on the doll has reaffirmed this, and mental health has declined just from this idea of how people treat you differently. it's actually made me want to work **less** because i'm really stubborn and if someone annoys or patronizes me i **hate** taking their advice. i would rather sacrifice my livelihood by living as cheaply as possible while still feeling secure by having access to necessities ie food/power/sleep then to constantly focus on money. for what? just so i can afford to eat out, shop and buy junk or go on some extravagent travel? i'd rather cook something myself (even if i dont have many of the skills atm), only buy necessities that i really really need, or go on cheap travels and experience the country in a less touristy manner. as such, i do not really care if i get 200k, 100k or 50k as my annual income, i already don't spend money as is (thats how ive got 20k in the bank without working. i do live with my parents though.). all i really want and value is time, so i can focus on other parts of my life.

also, i have like 0 life skills but im willing to learn if i'm not patronized constantly, which is the main reason i haven't up until now. that's a big reason why i want to travel and work overseas or live with others.

what do you think?

for example, when everyone returned back to campus after a year of online classes, our college security team &amp; local police started to crack down on parties, since some students started acting “out of line” when they began partying again. our off campus apartment parties dealt with property damage, vandalism, and students “acting out” (in a negative way) just because our college didn’t offer any in-person classes during covid for an entire school year (for good reason)

because of what happened at my college, i began to wonder how the social/party scene has changed when covid restrictions were lifted.

other than that, i've managed to stay afloat but the last couple weeks i've lost practically all motivation and have missed deadlines on assignments in practically every class. i'm super behind on my capstone research project and our presentations are 2 weeks out. i literally can't sleep and all i think about is how much work keeps piling up. i was hoping to check a few things off my list yesterday and then literally spent 10 hours on a lab and still didn't finish it.

sorry to tack onto your post like this but i just really needed to vent. i hope this lets you know that you're not alone. coming back to school as an older adult is really hard and it seems like none of my friends/family understand why its taking so long.

844,t3_1c7rtof,1713515672.0,"i asked this on another thread but wanted to hear your opinions or similar experience like mine?

i am a pre-nursing student who am at week 12 out of 15 left in this semester. this week, i took a quiz for this online class and got a 0 out of 1 on a fill-in-the-blank question because the system detected a space bar i made after typing the answer. however, i got the term right.  prior to this, i had a similar situation 7 weeks ago where i added a period at the end and was marked 1/2 off, but the term was correct. there are 2 instructors teaching the course and i didn’t it think through, so i just emailed one of them (instructor a) but i never got a response back. 
where i messed up was, i forgot about it since i was just overloaded with assignments (i get 12-13 assignments weekly of other classes), work, etc. if anything, i assumed that she would reach back to me, but it never happened. 

anyways, after seeing this error, it reminded me of the last quiz, so this time i emailed instructor b in case the other instructor may not reply again. i explained my situation and asked if both can be adjusted (i provided all screenshots) and she responds that i should have emailed her on the first quiz and instructor a on this week’s quiz because they’re in charge of certain modules. she adds that she will adjust this week’s for me, but the first “will not be addressed because it was 7 weeks ago”. 

i know where i messed up on my part. i was not attentive enough about making sure who to email because on each module, their names are provided on the side, and on the syllabus it briefly states that if we have any questions about a module, to email whoever is in charge. but at the same time, i feel this slight unfairness since instructor a could have at least reached out and let me know, but she didn’t. i also feel that because my answers were literally correct, that this can be adjusted. it’s not like i’m asking to retake the quiz but informing that there was an error on the system. i understand that being on top of things is preparing me for nursing, but i feel that this is unnecessary and ridiculous that my correct answer cannot be graded because i was 7 weeks late asking the instructor who was in charge of that week now. 

i was going to confront about this respectfully, but decided not to since i didn’t want to overstep myself and give her the wrong impression of me wanting to stand my ground for a simple error and misunderstanding. 

is this reasonable for me to feel this way? 
has this happened to anyone? 


edit: i wanted to clarify for those asking about the quiz being a small and minute point, this course is quiz-based and contributes 75% of the grade, so it makes a huge difference of my letter grade as it would have brought me from an 88% to a 90%. i did come to terms that it was some time ago and too late to ask, and although it’s just a few points, it also frustrates me knowing that i could have gotten an a.

so adhd is tough when you are a student. the dopamine deficiency in our brains makes it difficult to  stay focused and causes low motivation to the point of task paralysis. a fun fact is also the issues with our dopamine firing means our brains can't complete its reward circuit which means we literally discount time against rewards.

anyway - i created a study tool for us. it is called **kumo study** on the chrome store (totally free to use).  


basically the trick is to break down your study sessions into sets of work and rest (like if you were an athlete) and assign yourselves training sessions each day based on what you have due that week, what you have coming up and how you feel that day. you can't go hard out everyday or, like an athlete you will burn out.

so some ""sessions"" i do are:

&amp;#x200b;

* 3x 45mins work/7mins rest followed by 4x 52mins work/8mins rest and finish with 3x 15mins work/5mins rest  

* 4x 90mins work/17 mins rest followed by 8x 18mins work/7mins rest  

*  3x 48mins work/12mins rest followed by 3x 15mins work/5mins rest (on shorter days)

&amp;#x200b;

don't be afraid of taking rests!

the tool also has a citation generator (so you can generate the citations when on the website, all saved back to your dashboard) a website blocker when you are feeling extra unmotivated and bookmarking tool/weekly task list tool.

so in order to get your degree, you have to take specific education classes on top of your concentration classes. then, once you're done with all of that, you can go onto student teaching. 

i only had 3 classes left to take in my concentration. however, because the professors are severely understaffed, 2 out of those three classes are either not being offered for next semester, or are completely filled. i already reached out to some of the professors in them but i'm so so scared that i'll have to wait an entire year to student teach and it's really stressing me out. 

i guess i'm mostly just here for advice on how to cope? i really wanted to finish in five years, not five and a half. assuming the professors don't take pity on me, i'll either have to go to school part time and say bye bye to my financial aid, or take a bunch of extra bullshit classes i don't care about to reach fulltime status. i hate this so much, can someone try to point out a silver lining?

hi. so in 3 weeks i am finishing and submitting my msc thesis. i want to do something for my supervisor, to thank her for the collaboration, for trusting me with important data she has been gathering for 10+ years and of course for all the support. what should i give her? maybe flowers? 

i didn't do anything special for my supervisor when i finished my bsc thesis, first of all because it was during covid and second of all because he didn't really help me all that much. i can't repeat that now. the supervisor i have now has been absolutely wonderful, so i really feel like i have to do something for her, she definitely deserves it.

1. at **some** universities, with permission from administration, you can be enrolled at two different institutions simultaneously. as long as you do not already have too many transfer courses, then you can transfer the courses you need in. be careful. many universities only permit a certain number of courses during a certain ""remaining number of hours"".
2. if it's the university's fault that you do not have the classes you need to graduate, because of their lack of staffing, you can ask for **class substitutions**. an advisor would pick other classes that you could take instead of the ones that are not available that they are willing to use **in your case**.
3. sometimes an independent study can provide relief. for instance, a sympathetic dean or chair can ask faculty members to let you take these classes as ""independent studies"". there is still a syllabus. you still turn in the work and take the exams. but you're the only person in the class. you basically have weekly meetings with whoever is willing to work with you.

a good advisor or a good chair is an advocate. universities don't like anything that extends the years on their graduation rates. it's not good for accreditation. but everything depends on the unique situation.

**silver lining:** you're young. i'm retired. no need to rush out into the world many of us couldn't wait to crawl out of...**although i loved my job**. lol. you're in a magical time of life. i'm returning to school to take bs classes. because this is the first opportunity, i've really had to do it. i was so focused on achieving the b.s., mba, and phd...and then getting the right job that i had no time for the ""hey, i just think that would be interesting"" classes.

basically the family car had its tags removed and i can’t drive it obviously. i email all my teachers to let them know and to see if they could spot me for my situation (notes and physical assignments too but 99% of my work is online so that isn’t a big deal) one teacher said there’s no online section of class for notes and said “when you are back on campus, you can drop by office hours to look at the handwritten notes.” (i told her and everyone else that i have no clue how long i’ll be like this and the last time i saw em may be the last time till exams) but i asked if she could either send em by email or post them on canvas like my math and science teacher has already been doing since the semester started. 

3 days go by since i asked with no reply and i’m starting to struggle because the assignment i worked on yesterday had incomprehensible math and i emailed her again to let her know i was waiting on a response and i’m struggling to do the latest hw. i ended up relying on youtube and ran a practice problem just to make sure i had it figured out, which thankfully i did but the lack of notes have me anxious for the final exam.

she just emailed this morning congratulating me for finish the assignment, then basically paraphrased her last email after that.

so in short, i'm in my last year of college and i have two more semesters left, which means i can finish college successfully in a little more than six months and the academic phase of my life will be behind me.
 i also promised myself an internship with a very good company, but that's only if i finish my studies on time and don't delay with them.
 the thing is that the last two semesters are actually the hardest in the degree and in addition i already feel worn out and find myself barely studying even though i'm so close to the end and not only that, like i said if i don't finish on time the internship opportunity will also slip through my fingers.
 i would appreciate tips on how i can get into a crazy mode of learning in the next six months and how i can really manage to have iron discipline at least for the next six months, because yes i have the motivation that i can already see the end.
 i would appreciate learning tips and anything that could help me.

bonus question- my social life in college are actually great and i really feel like i'm going to miss my friends here, those of you who already graduatde - there is something you wish you did in college and didn't do ? socially wise ?

unfortunately that means youll also be competing with a huge amount of business majors in the job market. we cant all be managers.

you can choose the more technical business majors which are newer. supply chain, and management information systems are personally my only recommendation for the business college. 

however if youre truly invested into the business college. id highly recommend working full time somewhere anywhere and investing your savings into making your own business. experience will always win over education. its difficult to hire someone as a manager when their only experience running a business is in a classroom being told what to do, instead of someone who has actually put their hands into managing. during my undergrad i worked as a landscaper and 3 of my coworkers were business major graduates who were applying for jobs all the time and getting nothing back. thats how saturated the business market is. i had a job offer before i graduated in chemical engineering.

there is no scientific or medical evidence that abortion is dangerous or should be illegal. period. you're just not going to find such a thing. i used to sometimes see it argued, when i went to catholic school in the 90s, that there was a correlation between abortion and reproductive cancers, infertility, etc. but i think even that is not evidence based according to modern medicine. just a speculation from decades ago that was never proven.

also learning how to use a piece of software called (blender) google it, its free and it's 3d model software for game design unsure if you used it already or not as some game software has this tool built in as its own version. you can design skins and props to put into video games like the sims 3 you'd be designing your own models to then create the mod program or code, then you'd mod the game with your custom model design.

when you get to practice on your own terms you can have more free range of testing what stuff does in a program. also practice modding pc games like minecraft, sims 3, sims 4, skyrim work on how to mod those games. read the mod forums really deeply they teach alot of how the code works throughout those sites and there's usually always been someone able to answer questions in comments there too.",2024-04-19 13:27:50,"['practic', ""wo_n't"", 'overwhelm', 'feel', 'overwhelm', 'feel', 'think', 'harder', 'rememeb', 'inform', 'so_much', 'inform', 'also', 'muscl', 'memori', 'built', 'memori', 'as_wel', 'thìnking', 'get', 'faster', 'practic', 'daili', 'mayb', 'cours', 'program', 'secur', 'inform', 'technolog', 'mayb', 'take', 'a_few', 'cours', 'time', 'avail', 'design', 'graphic', 'design', 'video', 'edit', 'also', ""do_n't"", 'recomend', 'afford', 'perhap', 'around', '1000-1500', 'price', 'rang', 'video', 'edit', 'would', 'invest', 'start', 'busi', 'practic', 'home', 'hobbi', 'practic', 'code', 'creat', 'youtub', 'video', 'know', 'tutori', 'practic', 'creat', 'reddit', 'page', 'specif', 'channel', 'togeth', 'hands-on', 'experi', 'build', 'portfolio', 'also', 'design', 'websit', 'channel', 'also', 'learn', 'softwar', 'call', 'dreamweav', 'softwar', 'use', 'program', 'design', 'websit', 'mess', 'around', 'code', 'believ', 'also', 'the_sam', 'softwar', 'friendlier', 'user', 'interfac', 'also', 'make', 'easier', ""do_n't"", 'know', 'program', 'know', 'softwar', 'also', 'exist', 'dosnt', 'requir', 'program', ""it_'"", 'limit', 'also', 'learn', 'piec', 'softwar', 'call', 'blender', 'googl', 'free', ""it_'"", 'model', 'softwar', 'game', 'design', 'unsur', 'use', 'alreadi', 'game', 'softwar', 'tool', 'built', 'version', 'design', 'skin', 'prop', 'video', 'game', 'like', 'sim', 'design', 'model', 'creat', 'program', 'code', 'game', 'custom', 'model', 'design', 'practic', 'term', 'free', 'rang', 'test', 'stuff', 'program', 'also', 'practic', 'mod', 'game', 'like', 'minecraft', 'sim', 'sim', 'skyrim', 'work', 'game', 'read', 'forum', 'realli', 'deepli', 'teach', 'alot', 'code', 'work', 'throughout', 'site', 'usual', 'alway', 'someon', 'able_to', 'answer', 'question', 'comment']","[(2, 1), (7, 3), (18, 3), (26, 1), (28, 1), (35, 1), (42, 2), (57, 9), (76, 1), (78, 1), (80, 1), (84, 2), (97, 1), (101, 1), (108, 2), (127, 1), (135, 2), (136, 1), (144, 1), (153, 2), (154, 1), (182, 1), (195, 2), (196, 2), (200, 1), (229, 1), (230, 2), (235, 2), (252, 3), (265, 2), (271, 1), (290, 1), (309, 2), (313, 1), (316, 1), (321, 1), (322, 1), (335, 1), (337, 1), (350, 1), (364, 1), (365, 6), (378, 2), (421, 1), (444, 1), (464, 1), (474, 1), (480, 1), (492, 1), (496, 1), (510, 2), (528, 1), (563, 6), (591, 2), (621, 1), (630, 1), (654, 1), (676, 1), (696, 1), (724, 1), (751, 4), (787, 1), (791, 7), (800, 1), (824, 1), (833, 4), (835, 1), (855, 1), (862, 1), (921, 1), (951, 2), (978, 8), (991, 1), (997, 1)]",[0.         0.         0.00757576 ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

essentially most of the grade rests on exams, and i’ve got big ones coming up like everyone else. they’re multiple choice though.

all i care about is passing the class, and i have a little over a week to study for these tests. the only way i’m learning the material is through the textbook but it’s huge and i’m comically behind.

what’s a good method for learning the minimum amount from each chapter to make sure i get at least 70% of the total questions correct on these exams? should i start with practice problems and move backwards? any note taking tips? 

i don’t expect to pass which is ok, i was only taking the class as a pre-req to a grad school program i no longer want to do. but if i do, it would be great. thanks.

yall please dont fight me on this, i've done my time with a pro life instagram page and it was exhausting to debate and thats not what i'm here for. just trying to help op.

op, feel free to pm me for more source ideas, this was just off the top of my head.

i am religious but none of my reasons for being pro life are religious. i also think no matter what women choose they deserve love and compassion, and having to choose abortion is one of the hardest thing a person has to make a decision for.

oh also!! check out albany rose on facebook. she only recently became christian, but for years she was 'atheist pro life' on facebook. she might have good sources linked for non religious sources.

i also know princeton has a lot of embryology research. 

david daleiden also did an expose on planned parenthood selling aborted fetus parts and a quote i found really depressing was something along the lines of 'their humanity is not considered valid, yet its the same humanity that makes them valuable for research.'

i forgot who wrote this but i also really like the sled acronym of why fetuses are considered okay to kill versus us/the difference between us and a fetus

firstly, school supplies

- some nice mechanical pencils and pens. i recommend some pilot g-2s or similar. get a nice metal mechanical pencil. i personally like nicer pens and pencils because i'm less likely to misplace them. 

- notebooks, generally one per subject. i prefer all seperate, but if you like those 5 subject ones, get those.

- post-it notes. i have so many on my wall it's unbelievable. they're good to just note something down and stick to your wall.

- a laptop. find one that works for you. i recommend at least 8gb of ram though. you're going to have lots of tabs open on occasion, and need something that can handle that. it's 2024, unless you get the absolute cheapest thing, it'll likely have 8gbs of ram, make sure you check though.

- someone said a binder, get that if you want, i personally prefer folders. however, i actually haven't had much of a need for one. i rarely ever get papers. ymmv, get a few just in case of what you prefer.

secondly, dorm materials. i'm not going to touch on the large things, you discuss that with your roommates (i.e. 1 mini fridge or two? who brings a microwave (are you allowed to have one in your dorm?) etc etc). i'm just going to list small things you might skim over. things i wish i made sure to bring when i first came here

- snacks. snacks snacks snacks snacks. i genuinely thought i didn't need any because i'm not a snackish person. my god was i wrong. get yourself some chips, granola bars, anything. there'll be nights you're up late, the dining hall is closed, you don't have enough money to go buy mcdonalds. you'll want something you can eat in your dorm. even if it's just to ward off hunger enough to sleep and get breakfast in the morning.

- soda/la croix/whatever else you drink. again, there'll be times you just genuinely want some. 

- some form of scent. you likely can't have candles, maybe not even wax melts. but get something that gives off a pleasant scent. coordinate with your roommate on a good one for both of you. you're going to have dirty clothes in your dorm, plus possibly two teenagers, all in a very tight space. if you don't take precautions, it's going to smell. on a similar note, open your windows every so often.

- band-aids + other basic first aid stuff, tylenol, advil, ibuprofen, whatever you normally take. i've cut myself just enough to justify having a large box of bandaids. and i've gotten so many headaches that ibuprofen is a must.

- broom (if you have hard floors). i personally don't have one because i didn't think to bring one. you're going to be tracking in a lot of dirt. you'll definitely want one.

- extra blankets. my god, the amount of nights i've had to wear a sweater to bed cause my school fucked with the radiators and made them stop working. 

i can't really think of much else. other than a general recommendation for packing for a dorm. don't. over. pack. you'll think you've packed just enough, but you'll likely have too much. honestly, don't go so overboard, but it's ok if freshman year you overpack a bit. it'll suck trying to find all that space, but you'll learn how much space dorms have, and you'll be able to pack much smarter next year.",2024-04-19 15:39:31,"['finish', 'first', 'year', 'tell', 'everyth', 'actual', 'dorm', 'differ', 'rule', 'bring', 'go', 'mine', 'firstli', 'school', 'suppli', 'nice', 'mechan', 'pencil', 'pen', 'recommend', 'pilot', 'g-2', 'similar', 'nice', 'metal', 'mechan', 'pencil', 'person', 'like', 'nicer', 'pen', 'pencil', 'less', 'like', 'misplac', 'notebook', 'gener', 'subject', 'prefer', 'seper', 'like', 'subject', 'one', 'post-it', 'note', 'mani', 'wall', ""it_'"", 'unbeliev', ""they_'r"", 'good', 'note', 'someth', 'stick', 'wall', 'laptop', 'find', 'work', 'recommend', 'at_least', 'though', ""you_'r"", 'go', 'lots_of', 'tab', 'open', 'occas', 'need', 'someth', 'handl', ""it_'"", '2024', 'unless', 'absolut', 'cheapest', 'thing', 'like', '8gb', 'make_sur', 'check', 'though', 'someon', 'said', 'binder', 'want', 'person', 'prefer', 'folder', 'howev', 'actual', 'much', 'need', 'rare', 'ever', 'paper', 'ymmv', 'a_few', 'case', 'prefer', 'secondli', 'dorm', 'materi', 'go', 'touch', 'larg', 'thing', 'discuss', 'roommat', 'mini', 'fridg', 'bring', 'microwav', 'allow', 'dorm', 'go', 'list', 'small', 'thing', 'might', 'skim', 'thing', 'wish', 'made', 'sure', 'bring', 'first', 'came', 'snack', 'snack', 'snack', 'snack', 'snack', 'genuin', 'thought', ""did_n't"", 'need', 'snackish', 'person', 'wrong', 'chip', 'granola', 'bar', 'anyth', ""'ll_be"", 'night', ""you_'r"", 'late', 'dine', 'hall', 'close', ""do_n't"", 'enough', 'money', 'mcdonald', 'want', 'someth', 'dorm', 'even', ""it_'"", 'ward', 'hunger', 'enough', 'sleep', 'breakfast', 'morn', 'soda/la', 'croix/whatev', 'els', 'drink', ""'ll_be"", 'time', 'genuin', 'want', 'form', 'scent', 'like', ""ca_n't"", 'candl', 'mayb', 'even', 'melt', 'someth', 'give', 'pleasant', 'scent', 'coordin', 'roommat', 'good', ""you_'r"", 'go', 'dirti', 'cloth', 'dorm', 'plu', 'possibl', 'teenag', 'tight', 'space', ""do_n't"", 'take', 'precaut', ""it_'"", 'go', 'smell', 'similar', 'note', 'open', 'window', 'everi', 'often', 'band-aid', 'basic', 'first', 'stuff', 'tylenol', 'advil', 'ibuprofen', 'whatev', 'normal', 'take', 'enough', 'justifi', 'larg', 'bandaid', 'gotten', 'mani', 'headach', 'ibuprofen', 'must', 'broom', 'hard', 'floor', 'person', ""do_n't"", ""did_n't"", 'think', 'bring', ""you_'r"", 'go', 'track', 'a_lot', 'dirt', 'definit', 'want', 'extra', 'blanket', 'amount_of', 'night', 'wear', 'sweater', 'caus', 'school', 'fuck', 'radiat', 'made', 'stop', 'work', ""ca_n't"", 'realli', 'think', 'much', 'els', 'gener', 'recommend', 'pack', 'dorm', ""do_n't"", 'pack', 'think', 'pack', 'enough', 'like', 'too_much', 'honestli', ""do_n't"", 'overboard', ""it_'"", 'freshman_year', 'overpack', 'suck', 'tri', 'find', 'space', 'learn', 'much', 'space', 'dorm', ""'ll_be"", 'able_to', 'pack', 'much', 'smarter', 'next_year']","[(0, 1), (11, 3), (19, 1), (20, 1), (22, 2), (31, 2), (35, 1), (36, 4), (37, 1), (47, 1), (55, 1), (66, 1), (68, 3), (73, 1), (78, 2), (84, 5), (86, 2), (102, 2), (107, 2), (110, 2), (113, 7), (124, 1), (127, 1), (128, 1), (129, 2), (135, 2), (146, 1), (147, 1), (149, 4), (150, 1), (156, 1), (161, 1), (162, 1), (165, 1), (172, 1), (178, 1), (182, 1), (186, 4), (195, 5), (196, 6), (204, 1), (229, 3), (235, 1), (245, 1), (255, 2), (263, 4), (264, 1), (267, 1), (280, 4), (282, 4), (283, 2), (291, 1), (300, 1), (303, 1), (307, 2), (314, 1), (315, 1), (318, 1), (326, 1), (329, 1), (343, 2), (347, 1), (352, 1), (359, 2), (362, 1), (370, 1), (374, 1), (391, 3), (392, 1), (394, 1), (404, 3), (420, 2), (429, 1), (431, 1), (439, 7), (441, 1), (447, 1), (453, 1), (468, 1), (469, 1), (472, 2), (478, 3), (481, 2), (496, 1), (501, 1), (502, 1), (510, 1), (528, 1), (536, 1), (561, 2), (579, 1), (587, 4), (595, 3), (599, 2), (603, 1), (614, 3), (615, 1), (617, 1), (657, 1), (662, 1), (676, 1), (685, 1), (692, 4), (698, 1), (702, 1), (716, 2), (732, 1), (764, 1), (767, 2), (792, 1), (799, 2), (846, 1), (858, 1), (860, 1), (867, 1), (948, 1), (954, 1), (961, 1), (1000, 1)]",[0.00485437 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]
1044,t3_1c85uzc,1713555608.0,"hi! i posted something similar a few months back in a different subreddit, so apologies if you've already seen this post. anyways, i am majoring in environmental science and need to pick a specialization/emphasis for the major. i have gone through the options and am stuck between environmental policy or environmental biology. if each of these had the same amount and weight of pros and cons, i would choose biology, but there is one huge factor that is causing me to be nervous of choosing biology.

first, for environmental policy, i find policy research interesting, especially when it comes to the environment and conservation, and can see myself enjoying working in that field, and also the coursework that would get me there. however, i fear that the lack of lab-based courses would make me bored and less passionate.

for biology, i am so passionate about it, especially ecological biology. however, specializing in biology means i will have to take two more quarters of chemistry. i am terrible at chemistry and it will have been almost 2 years since i took first quarter general chemistry (and i barely passed that one), so i do not have as much information retained as other students will, since they will be going into second quarter chemistry with only a few weeks gap. i fear that specializing in biology will cause my gpa to drop because of chemistry, and since it has been so long since taking the first quarter of general chemistry, i might even fail second or third quarter chemistry. other than the chemistry aspect, there aren't many more negative aspects to this major for me. i really am passionate about biology, but i do not know if it is practical for me. because of this i don't know what to do. any tips, advice, etc will help!

tldr; i want to specialize in environmental biology, but am worried that a 2 year gap between general chemistry 1 and general chemistry 2 will cause me to fail my final two quarters of chemistry that i have to take, causing me to retake them, stay longer at my university, and my gpa to drop. additionally, i barely passed that first quarter of chemistry so because of the gap years, not much of that information i learned has been retained.

i’m 23(m) in the university about to complete. and i’m tired. i’m tired of everything — emotionally, mentally. i feel like i need like a month or so to just rest. i just need some time by myself where i will not worry about project or academics. but it isn’t coming soon. and it’s making me unproductive in school. i find socializing tiring. learning is tiring and not fun. basically nothing excites me, and neither do i have the energy to continue going even though i keep going. the energy to take my books and read it is not there. 

my heart is just not in it. and i’m just tired.  

i want to go back to those times where i learn so much that when i sleep, i dream about learning. learning was so fun. but now i’m tired. and i don’t know what to do. and at the same time too i have to make sure i pass and graduate. i’m so frustrated.

the volley-ball team which is the golden stars for the university lives in the same dorm as me and for some reasons that i don't know when i go outside to smoke a joint (which i go far enough of the windows and the door to be respectful) or even even if i just happen to be walking by outside and they seems me, they yell ""perv"" at me and other dumb insults probably for their half-ass tiktok clouts, which doesn't make any senses as to begin with i have never asked one single girl out here and even if i did it's not like it was sexual harrassment but to be fair most of them are insecure and are likely projecting since ironically recently there was a scandal about rape cases that even went through the media and a lot of those cases stems to the volley-ball team. this sucks because i haven't done anything mean spirited to them as i've simply minded my own business and hell i've helped them when they asked me to like when we were working out at the gym, i didn't feel like reporting since i know the administration is shit to begin with so i doubt they would do anything about or even worst it could backfire badly if i do that and they've found out about this, i just want to mind my own business and not having a bunch of braindead assholes on my back. anyway they have their own small minute of fame here but (i'm sorry for volley-ball players who are nice and passionated that is reading this) as there's no such thing as a professional paid career in volley-ball or at least here in canada unlike hockey, football, basketball, soccer, etc. so they can swallow their pride, i also flipped them off as they were shouting out of their windows and by doing so it pissed them off (i didn't understand what they've said just by the change of tone, i've had earbuds and honestly i just didn't give a fuck being high and listening to steve miller band) 🤣👍

*also no they aren't aware of my reddit account and i haven't told anybody so before you might do, i would advise not to as there's a lot of nsfw contents (though still not to be warranted as perv) but hey that's reddit and i'm anonymous and it's all fun 😂

**it's also really sad to read those comments and i'm glad that i'm not the one who went through that as you almost feel you're the crazy one by being ostracized by a population of jerks, interestingly thanks to the internet i've made only friends with people from the netherlands and germany, they were shocked to learn that bullying still happens in post-scholorship as they haven't experienced or witnessed that though if anyone here who is reading this as they are from those countries feel free to tell me otherwise if it's not the case 😥

wow. just got an email just now saying that i got rejected from an interview that would’ve helped my career. anyways that’s a bummer.

i was taking an exam that needed to be recorded and my bf walks in after i texted him saying not to. it’s not his fault but it’s all on video and i’m embarrassed. idk. i’m scared i can’t continue the semester and it worries me a lot. no one in my family has ever been to college or even graduated and i don’t know what i’m doing most of the time and i don’t know who to trust because my college is already trying to put money in their pockets.

edit: i struggle with adhd ptsd severe anxiety and depression for those asking

1063,t1_l0cvgv0,1713561562.0,"hey, i just finished writing my honors ba thesis in chemistry. i had a really hard time with it too, to the point that the first time i got feedback on it was 4 days before my defense, and that’s when they told me i had to rewrite everything. 

i know it feels hopeless, but try this method. build the presentation first, then fill in your essay to match it. 

and most importantly, remember your thesis is your journey through research, not the story of the research you were a part of. you are describing all of the things you directly did for your thesis and how they individually advanced your hypothesis. 

do you feel that you were on too many projects to pick one clear thesis? that’s fine, pick a larger topic and break it down into about 3 goals. the thesis itself is pretty flexible in terms of format, so you can craft it however you want, as long as it follows the overall guidelines. 

i know these examples may not apply to you exactly, but my dms are open if you want more specific advice.

most importantly, remember your mental health is vastly more important than any research you could do. take breaks, spread out the writing, and dont be too hard on yourself. it sounds like your advisor is awful for making you feel bad, but really, any lack of thesis material their fault for misguiding you. obviously you cant point that out to people though. if you are closer with other members of your thesis committee, you can also ask their advice before the defense. 

finally, remember, this isnt grades, its pass/fail. converting that to letter grades means even a c passes. your only goal is to finish the essay and tell the story of all of the things you've done. literally make a list if all the projects youve worked on and pick one figure/chart/picture from google that you can use to show your contribution. then go through and see if those pictures tell the whole story. if not, add more to each slide. if you run out if content, then go to your advisor.",2024-04-19 17:19:22,"['finish', 'write', 'honor', 'thesi', 'chemistri', 'realli', 'hard', 'time', 'point', 'first', 'time', 'feedback', 'day', 'defens', 'told_m', 'rewrit', 'everyth', 'know', 'feel', 'hopeless', 'method', 'build', 'present', 'first', 'fill', 'essay', 'match', 'importantli', 'rememb', 'thesi', 'journey', 'research', 'stori', 'research', 'paof', 'describ', 'thing', 'directli', 'thesi', 'individu', 'advanc', 'hypothesi', 'feel', 'mani', 'project', 'pick', 'clear', 'thesi', 'fine', 'pick', 'larger', 'topic', 'break', 'goal', 'thesi', 'pretti', 'flexibl', 'term', 'format', 'craft', 'howev', 'want', 'as_long', 'follow', 'overal', 'guidelin', 'know', 'exampl', 'appli', 'exactli', 'open', 'want', 'specif', 'advic', 'importantli', 'rememb', 'mental_health', 'vastli', 'import', 'research', 'could', 'take', 'break', 'spread', 'write', 'dont', 'hard', 'sounds_lik', 'advisor', 'aw', 'make', 'feel', 'realli', 'lack', 'thesi', 'materi', 'fault', 'misguid', 'obvious', 'cant', 'point', 'peopl', 'though', 'closer', 'member', 'thesi', 'committe', 'also', 'advic', 'defens', 'final', 'rememb', 'isnt', 'grade', 'pass/fail', 'convert', 'letter', 'grade', 'mean', 'even', 'pass', 'goal', 'finish', 'essay', 'tell', 'stori', 'thing', 'done', 'liter', 'make', 'list', 'project', 'youv', 'work', 'pick', 'figure/chart/pictur', 'googl', 'show', 'contribut', 'pictur', 'tell', 'whole', 'stori', 'slide', 'content', 'advisor']","[(11, 2), (22, 1), (35, 2), (36, 2), (57, 1), (78, 1), (86, 1), (107, 1), (108, 3), (128, 2), (129, 1), (135, 1), (139, 1), (141, 1), (144, 2), (158, 1), (169, 1), (173, 1), (178, 1), (179, 1), (182, 2), (186, 2), (201, 2), (203, 1), (207, 1), (210, 3), (223, 1), (243, 2), (252, 2), (258, 1), (294, 1), (311, 1), (322, 1), (323, 1), (326, 1), (347, 1), (348, 1), (385, 1), (386, 1), (388, 1), (393, 1), (415, 1), (447, 2), (466, 2), (470, 1), (471, 3), (492, 1), (501, 2), (518, 1), (526, 3), (530, 2), (533, 2), (564, 1), (569, 1), (594, 1), (602, 1), (621, 1), (638, 3), (670, 1), (703, 1), (712, 1), (723, 1), (733, 1), (736, 2), (770, 1), (773, 1), (822, 1), (836, 1), (838, 1), (851, 1), (860, 1), (872, 1), (877, 2), (885, 1), (905, 2), (930, 1), (986, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

for starters, i am from the south and i am transferring to a college in my hometown, so a storage unit here is not the solution. 

also, i am self reliant for this move out and renting a u-haul is just not happening. also, last august my parents and i did a 2 day drive to get here, but that is not going to be possible for the move out. 
i am going to be flying home in may with a carry on and a checked bag so i will definitely be able to put my essentials in those. 

i have looked up online and am seeing that shipping five 16x16x12 boxes thru ups/fedex will end up costing around 400$ for ground shipping. 

i have done some online searching, but there isn’t really much of a clear guide here so im wondering if anyone has some first hand experience. 

i was just wondering if there was any more cost effective ways of going about this. if shipping 2 larger boxes is easier, more smaller boxes, whatever please let me know. tia! 😀

do colleges of this size usually have some sort of club where you can play competitive sports against other schools but not need to be crazy good? if so, what's it like, and how good do you generally have to be to join? i haven't taken a look at my college's list of clubs yet, but there's supposedly about 1,000 (including crazy stuff like a lactose intolerant club) which would make looking for what i want a little difficult. if there's not a way to continue being competitive in sports through college, what ways have you guys been able to continue your sports outside of school?

for context, my 5k time in cc was 19:43 (i ran a 19:38 earlier today, although that won't make much of a difference). i know that in college they run 10ks for cross country, and my fastest 10k was just shy of 45 minutes (but i ran that last year and could probably run sub 44 or sub 43 in another week if i tried). for tennis, i have been shuffled around from playing 4 singles varsity, 1 singles jv, and 3 doubles varsity at my school which is one of the best in my conference and will likely make team state this year.",2024-04-19 18:42:24,"['head', 'colleg', 'engin', 'fall', 'place', 'go', '50,000', 'student', 'want', 'be_abl', 'play', 'tenni', 'cross', 'countri', 'colleg', ""wo_n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'best', 'best', 'particip', 'main', 'colleg', 'team', 'howev', 'alway', 'still', 'love', 'play', 'sport', 'competit', 'school', 'high_school', 'excit', 'challeng', 'oppon', 'great', 'memori', 'made', 'teammat', 'thrill', 'better', 'ever', 'thing', ""do_n't"", 'want', 'goodby', 'could', 'practic', 'tenni', 'coupl', 'friend', 'colleg', 'although', 'would', 'the_sam', 'colleg', 'size', 'usual', 'soof', 'club', 'play', 'competit', 'sport', 'school', 'need', 'crazi', 'good', 'like', 'good', 'gener', 'join', 'taken', 'look_at', 'colleg', 'list', 'club', 'supposedli', '1,000', 'includ', 'crazi', 'stuff', 'like', 'lactos', 'intoler', 'club', 'would', 'make', 'look', 'want', 'littl', 'difficult', 'continu', 'competit', 'sport', 'colleg', 'way', 'guy', 'able_to', 'continu', 'sport', 'outsid', 'school', 'context', 'time', '19:43', '19:38', 'earlier', 'today', 'although', ""wo_n't"", 'make', 'much', 'differ', 'know', 'colleg', '10k', 'cross', 'countri', 'fastest', 'minut', 'last', 'year', 'could', 'probabl', 'anoth', 'week', 'tri', 'tenni', 'shuffl', 'around', 'play', 'singl', 'varsiti', 'singl', 'doubl', 'varsiti', 'school', 'best', 'confer', 'like', 'make', 'team', 'state', 'year']","[(5, 8), (15, 1), (31, 4), (33, 1), (35, 1), (36, 3), (37, 2), (53, 1), (55, 1), (61, 1), (68, 1), (84, 1), (99, 1), (105, 1), (112, 1), (113, 1), (120, 1), (127, 1), (131, 1), (134, 1), (136, 2), (139, 2), (143, 1), (144, 3), (153, 1), (155, 1), (178, 1), (186, 1), (196, 3), (200, 2), (206, 1), (217, 1), (225, 1), (232, 1), (252, 1), (253, 1), (255, 1), (259, 1), (263, 1), (271, 1), (275, 1), (280, 1), (290, 1), (318, 1), (343, 3), (347, 1), (367, 1), (377, 1), (437, 3), (445, 1), (449, 1), (463, 2), (480, 1), (481, 1), (487, 1), (496, 1), (499, 2), (523, 1), (549, 1), (576, 1), (596, 4), (610, 2), (616, 1), (671, 1), (690, 1), (707, 3), (713, 1), (714, 4), (715, 2), (727, 1), (763, 1), (764, 1), (774, 1), (775, 1), (791, 1), (796, 2), (798, 2), (815, 3), (816, 1), (864, 1), (869, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

also where i go to school there is a huge push for getting students to be good at managing time, setting goals, and being productive with their day. this gives the appearance of business school being easy as a lot of us business students, due to this push, are more likely to be better at time management than our academic counterparts so we can usually go hangout and easier to have a social life. also huge push for networking and getting to know people in the business school and i had a class where i had to report on my networking activities every week. this sounds great as many will say you get credit for being social but at the same time when i have a busy week i have to be on top of it so that i can make time to have networking opportunities throughout the week. unlike my engineering friends who when they had a busy week could just focus on their schoolwork. this networking assignment tbh isn’t a big deal but it is something to bring up.

but that’s my observation and hope that helps. tbh most of the time, at least at my university, we just don’t care enough when people say business school is easy. we are just trying to survive and get a degree like everyone else.",2024-04-19 19:37:07,"['univers', 'gener', 'understand', 'as_wel', 'depends_on', 'compar', 'like', 'busi', 'school', 'easi', 'project', 'paper', 'case', 'studi', 'time', 'differ', 'kind_of', 'hard', 'compar', 'engin', 'a_lot', 'math', 'complex', 'concept', 'learn', 'busi', 'studi', 'complet', 'differ', 'kind_of', 'knowledg', 'studi', 'compani', 'action', 'studi', 'compani', 'improv', 'differ', 'area', 'engin', 'student', 'often', 'busi', 'school', 'easi', 'littl', 'rel', 'simpl', 'math', 'done', 'also', 'studi', 'complex', 'issu', 'global', 'ethic', 'polit', 'market', 'strategi', 'good', 'demograph', 'economi', 'respond', 'certain', 'legisl', 'decis', 'differ', 'also', 'statist', 'depart', 'school', 'physic', 'scienc', 'studi', 'found', 'busi', 'student', 'univers', 'second', 'highest', 'workload', 'behind', 'nurs', 'student', 'also', 'school', 'huge', 'push', 'get', 'student', 'good', 'manag', 'time', 'set', 'goal', 'product', 'give', 'appear', 'busi', 'school', 'easi', 'a_lot', 'busi', 'student', 'push', 'like', 'better', 'time', 'manag', 'academ', 'counterpart', 'usual', 'hangout', 'easier', 'social', 'life', 'also', 'huge', 'push', 'network', 'get', 'know', 'peopl', 'busi', 'school', 'class', 'repoon', 'network', 'activ', 'everi', 'week', 'sound', 'great', 'mani', 'credit', 'social', 'the_sam', 'time', 'busi', 'week', 'make', 'time', 'network', 'opportun', 'throughout', 'week', 'unlik', 'engin', 'friend', 'busi', 'week', 'could', 'focus_on', 'schoolwork', 'network', 'assign', 'isn_’', 'deal', 'someth', 'bring', 'observ', 'hope', 'help', 'time', 'at_least', 'univers', 'don_’', 'care', 'enough', 'peopl', 'busi', 'school', 'easi', 'tri', 'surviv', 'degre', 'like', 'everyon', 'els']","[(0, 2), (31, 7), (33, 5), (35, 6), (44, 1), (48, 2), (55, 1), (57, 4), (80, 1), (82, 1), (86, 1), (94, 3), (101, 10), (103, 1), (111, 1), (112, 1), (116, 1), (132, 1), (134, 4), (138, 1), (139, 1), (144, 1), (149, 1), (154, 2), (166, 6), (194, 1), (196, 3), (204, 1), (221, 1), (235, 1), (252, 1), (253, 1), (267, 1), (268, 1), (271, 1), (280, 1), (285, 1), (307, 1), (308, 1), (310, 1), (311, 1), (314, 1), (318, 4), (339, 2), (343, 2), (349, 1), (356, 1), (377, 1), (388, 2), (395, 1), (399, 1), (414, 1), (425, 1), (446, 1), (455, 1), (459, 2), (464, 1), (480, 1), (481, 1), (482, 1), (487, 1), (501, 1), (506, 1), (522, 1), (532, 2), (543, 1), (567, 4), (580, 1), (603, 1), (642, 1), (643, 1), (648, 1), (652, 1), (680, 1), (692, 1), (694, 1), (701, 4), (732, 1), (749, 1), (768, 2), (778, 1), (789, 1), (790, 1), (792, 1), (816, 3), (826, 3), (843, 1), (854, 1), (862, 1), (877, 1), (879, 1), (888, 1), (893, 2), (897, 1), (899, 2), (905, 1), (962, 1), (964, 1), (988, 1), (1002, 1)]",[0.01226994 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

what’s really frustrating for me is not having a clear idea as to what we’re going to be tested on. each midterm pulls from the previous ~12 lectures, some of which concern multiple topics. but there’s only 6 questions on the midterms.

my motivation to memorize how to do whatever random shit it may be to a jumbled clusterfuck of letters and numbers, when there’s a less than 50% chance i will ever be tested on the topic . . . it’s not high to be honest. there’s also no consistency or natural flow. integration, series, surface area/arc length, vectors, differentials. gives me whiplash.

and then sometimes the exams don’t even let us solve the problems the way we were taught to solve them? had a question that said “use ideas related to a taylor series to do shit. do not differentiate the bullshit” like professor, you taught us to use differentiation and now you’re telling us to use “ideas related to a taylor series” like wtf is even that

but to be honest, put your graduation date for your undergraduate degree on your resume. you are not obligated to put a start date.

in most cases, you wouldn't put your high school information on your resume if you have an undergraduate degree. as for the gpa, that depends on the job. they want to know that you have the degree. internship, yes, if relevant. no to the relative's estate, unless you want them called as a reference and there was a real work title to it **unless** it's related to what you'll actually be doing. just my opinion.

once you pick that, you’ll need the following. 

- good grades. you’ll want at least a 3.5 to be competitive for most programs. 

- patient care experience. work as a cna, emt, home health aid, etc. get experience being around patients. 

- shadowing. you need to shadow doctors to make sure this career is really for you first. you’ll also need shadowing hours to apply. 

- extracurriculars. join an intramural sports team, the microbiology club, a disability awareness group, your pre-med chapter at your college, etc. get involved on campus. 

- volunteering. get out in your community. look for local ram clinics, volunteer within schools, etc. this looks great on applications. 

- research. you’ll want to look into research opportunities on campus. this may not be necessary, but it’s a huge advantage if you can do some undergrad research with a microbio or anatomy professor. 

- mcat scores. you’ll study for several months for the mcat. a 500 is considered the minimum to apply - people have gotten in with lower, but 500 is sort of the unspoken magic number.

it feels weird because i don't feel lonely at all, if anything i feel more fulfilled and mature. spending and dedicating my time to maintaining healthy and meaningful relationships. nowadays if i do go out at night i try to go to chill bars and places to lounge and talk about everything with buddies, try to get home before midnight rather than dancing in a sweaty bar till 2am trying to score chicks.

1219,t1_l0efbeg,1713585567.0,"you're not too stupid, your brain just operates on a higher challenge level.

as someone with adhd, but unmedicated (i like to live dangerously, lol) this is what i find useful:

1. majoring in something i am interested in. i find the classes i am interested in i focus more and i am more motivated to do the work and do well. place me in a medieval studies class i can focus on that shit all semester long. put me in an english lit course and i will bust my ass, but i won't be as focused or motivated. if you want me to die a horrible and painful mental death... put me in a math class.

2. study groups. i find that it is easier and more motivating to study in a group. that way there is more motivation to study and less motivation to check your phone and go on 'little' breaks. my classmates act as if i am doing them a huge favour by organizing study groups for tests, but in reality... those groups help me.

3. routine. get into a routine that is doable and stick to it. i found having a routine where doing certain things before doing coursework made getting into the coursework easier. i hope that makes sense. the disadvantage to this is you will feel soo lost when the semester is over and you won't know what to do with yourself.

4. becoming familiar with the profs. i am not talking about making friends with them, but make sure they know who you are. i find that if the prof knows me then there is more motivation to do better because i do not want them to think ill of me. it is strange, but it works.

5. susing out profs who are flexible with deadlines. i always email a prof before i register for a course to see who is more willing to extend deadlines and who has deadlines set in stone. having a prof who is willing to extend a deadline makes all the difference when you get a random hyperfixation or have a period where your focus is just not there.

6. take a reduced course load. i have never taken more than 3 and that is what my brain can handle. if you have an official diagnosis for adhd you should be able to get accommodations where a full course load for you would be 3 instead of 4. you might be able to get other accommodations as well; it is worth talking to the disability center at your school.

7. alarms. alarms on when to start studying. alarms for classes. alarms for everything. and back up alarms as well.

8. never study at home! i have my places to study and none of them are at home. home is full of distractions. 'i need to write that paper, but before we do that lets clean up that doom pile that has been there for the past several months'. i study on the quiet floor of my university's library or i use my noise cancelling headphones and study at the mcdonald's down the road from me. never. never at home.",2024-04-19 23:59:27,"[""you_'r"", 'stupid', 'brain', 'oper', 'higher', 'challeng', 'level', 'someon', 'adhd', 'unmed', 'like', 'live', 'danger', 'find', 'use', 'major', 'someth', 'interested_in', 'find', 'class', 'interested_in', 'focu', 'motiv', 'work', 'well', 'place', 'mediev', 'studi', 'class', 'focus_on', 'shit', 'semest', 'long', 'english', 'cours', 'bust', ""wo_n't"", 'focus', 'motiv', 'want', 'horribl', 'pain', 'mental', 'death', 'math', 'class', 'studi', 'group', 'find', 'easier', 'motiv', 'studi', 'group', 'motiv', 'studi', 'less', 'motiv', 'check', 'phone', ""'littl"", 'break', 'classmat', 'huge', 'favour', 'organ', 'studi', 'group', 'test', 'realiti', 'group', 'help', 'routin', 'routin', 'doabl', 'stick', 'found', 'routin', 'certain', 'thing', 'coursework', 'made', 'get', 'coursework', 'easier', 'hope', 'make', 'sens', 'disadvantag', 'feel', 'lost', 'semest', ""wo_n't"", 'know_what', 'becom', 'familiar', 'prof', 'talk', 'make', 'friend', 'make_sur', 'know', 'find', 'prof', 'know', 'motiv', 'better', 'want', 'think', 'strang', 'work', 'suse', 'prof', 'flexibl', 'deadlin', 'alway', 'email', 'prof', 'regist', 'cours', 'will', 'extend', 'deadlin', 'deadlin', 'stone', 'prof', 'will', 'extend', 'deadlin', 'make', 'differ', 'random', 'hyperfix', 'period', 'focu', 'take', 'reduc', 'cours', 'load', 'never', 'taken', 'more_than', 'brain', 'handl', 'offici', 'diagnosi', 'adhd', 'be_abl', 'accommod', 'full', 'cours', 'load', 'would', 'instead', 'might', 'be_abl', 'accommod', 'as_wel', 'worth', 'talk', 'disabl', 'center', 'school', 'alarm', 'alarm', 'stastudi', 'alarm', 'class', 'alarm', 'everyth', 'back', 'alarm', 'as_wel', 'never', 'studi', 'home', 'place', 'studi', 'none', 'home', 'home', 'full', 'distract', 'need', 'write', 'paper', 'let', 'clean', 'doom', 'pile', 'has_been', 'past', 'sever', 'month', 'studi', 'quiet', 'floor', 'univers', 'librari', 'nois', 'cancel', 'headphon', 'studi', 'mcdonald', 'road', 'never', 'never', 'home']","[(4, 1), (31, 1), (36, 2), (54, 2), (59, 1), (65, 1), (68, 1), (75, 2), (78, 1), (80, 2), (94, 1), (99, 2), (103, 4), (106, 1), (108, 1), (110, 4), (111, 1), (112, 1), (117, 1), (118, 4), (122, 1), (135, 2), (136, 1), (144, 3), (149, 1), (154, 1), (160, 1), (162, 1), (166, 9), (172, 1), (177, 1), (186, 1), (194, 1), (196, 1), (200, 2), (225, 2), (229, 1), (230, 1), (252, 2), (254, 1), (255, 1), (290, 1), (304, 1), (318, 1), (321, 4), (326, 1), (329, 1), (350, 1), (373, 1), (374, 1), (377, 1), (378, 4), (389, 1), (395, 1), (396, 1), (402, 1), (407, 1), (408, 2), (414, 1), (416, 1), (419, 1), (423, 4), (435, 1), (436, 1), (448, 1), (449, 1), (455, 1), (458, 2), (464, 2), (467, 1), (503, 2), (517, 1), (528, 1), (530, 1), (547, 2), (548, 1), (587, 1), (589, 1), (611, 5), (660, 4), (663, 1), (677, 3), (717, 1), (725, 1), (727, 1), (736, 1), (759, 1), (766, 2), (781, 1), (792, 1), (801, 1), (844, 1), (849, 2), (881, 2), (893, 1), (899, 1), (900, 1), (913, 2), (931, 1), (937, 6), (948, 1), (961, 1), (969, 1), (975, 1), (976, 1), (986, 1), (994, 1), (1005, 1), (1010, 1)]",[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.00591716]

i had dropped out of my first attempt at college and went to work in the service industry in the new orleans french quarter. nothing to do but 24 hour bars and that's how people socialized.

""they"" say it's the thing to do where all the socialization happens and the cute girls go, but it really is over hyped.

but i think some time around my late 20s, it lost it's luster. gradually tapered off going until i don't think i have set foot in a bar in years.

my reasons?

* it's expensive even if you are only drinking pbr and cheap draft.
* i never really made friends in there.
* i did manage to ""pick up"" or ""get picked up"" and did have a one night stand or three over the years i went, but it was rare and unfulfilling. the better relationships were from online or through social/work networks. and nowadays, people frown on that because both of y'all are too drunk and there's been some embarrassing moments and waking up next to crazy.
* most bars are loud as hell and no meaningful conversations were ever had.
* got tired of felling like shit if i accidentally over drank.
* being too drunk out and about late at night (or anytime really or any place other than the house) is a legal and safety risk.
* while there are older people bars, past 30, this shit is just sad. jumps the shark probably by mid 20s and only marginally worthwhile younger than that.",2024-04-20 02:35:30,"['happen', 'year', 'later', 'drop', 'first', 'attempt', 'colleg', 'went', 'work', 'servic', 'industri', 'orlean', 'french', 'quarter', 'noth', 'hour', 'bar', 'peopl', 'social', ""it_'"", 'thing', 'social', 'happen', 'cute', 'girl', 'realli', 'hype', 'think', 'time', 'around', 'late', 'lost', ""it_'"", 'luster', 'gradual', 'taper', 'go', ""do_n't"", 'think', 'foot', 'year', 'reason', ""it_'"", 'expens', 'even', 'drink', 'cheap', 'draft', 'never', 'realli', 'made', 'friend', 'manag', 'pick', 'pick', 'night', 'stand', 'three', 'year', 'went', 'rare', 'unfulfil', 'better', 'relationship', 'onlin', 'social/work', 'network', 'nowaday', 'peopl', 'frown', ""y'all"", 'drunk', 'embarrass', 'moment', 'wake', 'next', 'crazi', 'bar', 'loud', 'hell', 'meaning', 'convers', 'ever', 'tire', 'fell', 'like', 'shit', 'accident', 'drank', 'drunk', 'late', 'night', 'anytim', 'realli', 'place', 'hous', 'legal', 'safeti', 'risk', 'older', 'peopl', 'bar', 'past', 'shit', 'jump', 'shark', 'probabl', 'margin', 'worthwhil', 'younger']","[(5, 1), (11, 1), (35, 1), (37, 3), (40, 1), (66, 2), (84, 1), (88, 1), (107, 1), (112, 1), (113, 1), (118, 1), (120, 1), (130, 1), (133, 1), (135, 1), (153, 1), (182, 3), (186, 1), (187, 2), (191, 1), (195, 3), (196, 1), (209, 1), (215, 1), (225, 1), (229, 2), (236, 1), (255, 1), (339, 2), (360, 2), (377, 1), (388, 3), (397, 1), (419, 1), (424, 1), (435, 1), (450, 1), (507, 1), (526, 2), (532, 1), (565, 1), (571, 1), (574, 1), (575, 1), (632, 1), (663, 2), (685, 1), (701, 1), (708, 1), (722, 1), (750, 1), (764, 1), (796, 1), (799, 2), (870, 1), (968, 1), (980, 1), (990, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

as a teenager in high school i dealt with a lot of bad people which made my mental health worse. fast forward, in 2019 it is affecting my college days by me completely flunking out in cc. mind you, i still have that first university’s debt to think about while attending school and during high school i had serious trouble attending class due to bullies. 

then, more down the road i attended a local community college instead of one to be a student athlete. and, things seemed to be better, i started getting credits towards an aa degree, not c’s either— all as. i never really had a problem attending class except one semester where the workload seemed impossible for me so i had to withdraw. as semesters gone by, and me getting used to the community college environment, i did really well while attending there. took me three years to get the aa degree, and got a’s in all my classes, except math, passed with a c. 

what i am trying to get at though compared to the normal undergraduate college student i would be over age (23m). while most students graduate on time at the age of 22 with a bachelors. i feel so down because of this and feel like a failure almost every day. i notice students start master’s programs later in life not right after their bachelors. so that alone is keeping me from feeling really really bad about myself. 😕

this returns me to my initial question: why do i feel so behind in my college journey? it makes me really depressed.

i hope you're all doing well. i wanted to share a bit about where i am in life right now and ask for some encouragement as i consider taking a big step forward.

i completed a two-year degree in culinary arts and a four-year bachelor's in entrepreneurship. currently, i'm running my own business that brings in a gross income of $26,000 usd per month. while i've found success in entrepreneurship, i can't shake the feeling that there's more out there for me.

i've been contemplating the idea of ""studying again,"" and honestly, it's a bit daunting. but when i think about the reasons for studying abroad, it ignites a fire in me. i crave new opportunities, i want to change my life, and i'm hungry for personal growth and purpose. bringing my parents to abroad, being independent, and becoming a global citizen are just some of the dreams driving me forward. plus, the idea of learning more about myself, experiencing a better climate, and having more career opportunities abroad is incredibly enticing.

yet, despite these aspirations, i find myself needing a bit of encouragement. stepping out of my comfort zone and into the unknown is scary, but i believe it's the right path for me. so, if anyone has been through a similar journey or has some words of wisdom to share, i would greatly appreciate it.

what do i do?

here are some of my options (all 3 credits):

&amp;#x200b;

* anth 102 - intro to physical anthropology 
* ast 103 - introductory astronomy: the solar system 
* biol 101 - biology for non-majors
* env 101 - intro to environmental science 
* geog 103 - physical geography 
* geog 117 - meteorology/climatology 
* geol 100 - earthquakes, volcanoes &amp; natural disasters 
* hhp 123 - intro to the human body
* phys 110 - conceptual physics 

i'm interested to see others' input on this.

is it wrong to say i want to have a manic episode where i can just power, though, and get all of this done? all that i need to get done instead of feeling drained for simply going across the room? 

i truly don't know what to do to help. i just know i need help, and i need it fast. but when someone asks me what can they do.... i truly don't know. i can't think of what i need. i can't think of how to explain it takes too much energy. and so i end up stagnant. frozen. i am staring at my screen, trying to help the switch in my brain. 

everything aches. everything hurts. i have headaches and body aches, and my stomach is all messed up. i don't know what to do or get out of this soul draining fog.

i was considering uic, but i haven’t seen many arts programs from them. i’ve looked at all the majors from all these schools and it’s the arts majors i’m struggling with. the u has film &amp; media arts, loyola has photography, and depaul has art, media and design where i’m considering a concentration in studio arts.


i also want to consider at greek life and party schools. i’ve seen some sorority stuff at uic and the u, but i don’t know anything about loyola or depaul. i don’t necessarily want a party school as i’ve never been one to step out of my comfort zone, but i figure college is the time to do it so i’m thinking of possibly joining a sorority. i just don’t want college life to be super dead in terms of partying lol

i also want to live in the city, so i’m leaning more towards the chicago schools than the u. if anyone has any info on any of these schools that would be great! all i’ve seen so far from reddit posts are that depaul is for business and loyola is for science and that doesn’t really help me so… :/

i have a b (barely), and there is a rule according to the syllabus you must pass the final exam to pass the class. i did decent on my first exam, very very bad on my second exam due to things going on not having time to study until now. third exam better but still an f. so i don't feel prepared to be able to pass the final exam.. i think if i get a d then it will be curved to a c (exams are curved), so i think the lowest i can possibly get is a d to pass the final. which considering my score before curve on 2/3 exams was an f i don't think it's going to happen :/... so if i pass the final, i have a b, if i fail it, i get an f i assume.

should i have dropped the class or is there hope? what should i do? also it's a class for my major and i assume future classes will be built upon it.

instead of management of information systems, it said business administration (information systems). for the past three months as well as my internships, i've always listed it as management of information systems (because thats literally what its named in  the sdsu department website and how every professor said the program name was...).

why is it different? i had a huge face-palm right now because nearly all of my applications has the name different. would this be an issue?",2024-04-20 21:15:01,"['diego', 'state', 'univers', 'paof', 'program', 'stand', 'manag', 'inform', 'system', 'basic', 'degre', 'half', 'java', 'python', 'html/css', 'machin', 'learn', 'class', 'half', 'busniess', 'suppli', 'chain', 'manag', 'graduat', 'spring', 'week', 'alreadi', 'appli', 'boatload', 'list', 'howev', 'friend', 'last', 'year', 'show', 'degre', 'total', 'differ', 'thought', 'name', 'instead', 'manag', 'inform', 'system', 'said', 'busi', 'administr', 'inform', 'system', 'past', 'three', 'month', 'as_wel', 'internship', 'alway', 'list', 'manag', 'inform', 'system', 'that', 'liter', 'name', 'sdsu', 'depart', 'websit', 'everi', 'professor', 'said', 'program', 'name', 'differ', 'huge', 'face-palm', 'right_now', 'nearli', 'applic', 'name', 'differ', 'would', 'issu']","[(18, 4), (37, 1), (44, 1), (53, 1), (73, 2), (94, 1), (101, 1), (103, 1), (112, 1), (117, 1), (134, 1), (136, 1), (155, 1), (178, 2), (183, 1), (203, 1), (235, 1), (246, 1), (258, 1), (260, 1), (290, 1), (300, 1), (304, 1), (306, 1), (308, 1), (309, 1), (314, 1), (316, 1), (318, 3), (347, 1), (354, 1), (365, 2), (392, 1), (419, 1), (446, 2), (464, 1), (532, 4), (558, 1), (565, 1), (594, 1), (647, 1), (723, 1), (753, 2), (782, 1), (813, 4), (837, 4), (840, 1), (842, 1), (870, 1), (893, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

in spring 2025, i will need to take a student teaching practicum course that is incredibly demanding and both of my advisors were against me taking the 2 additional courses i wanted to, though they said 1 additional course should be manageable. 

if i still want to graduate by may 2025, that means i will be taking 4 classes in fall of 2024. the reason why this is more doable than just taking another course over the coming summer is i have qualified for a really good scholarship starting in the fall that will cover most of my tuition. 

the classes i will be taking are two bio classes, english 102, and an education course. one of the bios and education are in person while the others are online. 

i guess i’m just looking for advice on balancing myself this fall? what worked for you when you were full time both in school and work? i don’t want this to be a consistent thing, just this semester so i can focus solely on my student teaching next spring (and one psychology course).

&gt;should i be trying to have fun while i'm still young?

personally, i think the main problem here is that your perception of fun is having sex, getting drunk, and dating girls.

as some other commenters have said, you can still have fun and be social without jeopardizing your academics. join clubs. apply for student government. get a job on-campus. get an internship.

i'm about to finish my first year at college and it was phenomenal. i have never had a sip of alcohol, nor do i ever want to. nothing about alcohol, drugs, sex, or anything else in that realm seems fun to me, although i understand people are interested in different things.

point is, i've done none of those things so far and i've still managed to have an amazing experience. i joined a leadership group where i actively volunteered around campus. i became president of the history club and got accepted into phi alpha theta, the national history honor society. i got an on-campus job as a peer advisor and recently got an additional on-campus job as an orientation leader for the summer.

i’m kinda speculating here i guess like she may not be in to me at all but she asks me a lot of questions in the lab and by email, far more than any other student i have.
sometimes it seems like she is just asking these questions to make conversation other times she actually kind of does need help with stuff.
 
when i first got an email from her asking some like marginally frivolous clarifying question it was late and i was like “why is she emailing me at this time” so i investigated on ig and lo and behold she is from the same county as me and went to the high school next to mine so i thought like “wow i have even more in common with her” and her academic attitude made more sense i guess.

i only have 3 clues she might be into me.
1. lots of emails asking me for help with stuff (many after 11 pm)
2. one time she like broke formality and ended an email with a nickname not her name (probably should think nothing of it)
3. there was one time and there may have been others where she asked me a question and was like noticeably up in my personal space like i am sort of a close talker myself but she really came in close to ask this question.
also i feel like i’m a fairly attractive person not model hot or anything but it wouldn’t be outside the realm of possibility that she likes me might just be grasping at strings though.

also what do i do? the semester is sort of winding down. i’m not dumb enough to hit her up before final marks are due. but after do i say something to her? give her my number? try to be platonic? follow her on social media? like i would be kicking myself forever if i didn’t try to at least stay in touch and be friendly. i don’t want to be weird about it though?

right now, i’m a public affairs major and i’m thinking of double majoring with psych. reason i chose this was because with public affairs, i feel like a career working for government/public policy gives you the opportunity to really make a difference from the root of problems (like you help change the structure of society, if that makes sense) and help a wide amount of people in a way i feel like other majors aren’t necessarily. i also found my comparative government class interesting in high school, and i would like to work in food policy or healthcare policy. psych because i am extremely interested in social norms and psych is interesting anyway. wanted to double major because with public affairs i didn’t feel that my interests were being fulfilled all the way.

tl;dr

i’m currently a public affairs major. got in it because it seems like a major that will truly help you make a difference and i found my gov classes interesting in high school. but somehow my hs classes were more interesting than my college ones now.

other majors i’m considering: “health promotion, nutrition and exercise science”, “philosophy, politics, and economics”, public health, psych/sociology

i’m doubting public affairs tho because politics seems so overly beraucratic and, well, “politics”. not to mention the extremely polarizing atmosphere. maybe i’d like public affairs more if it weren’t so us-focused…",2024-04-21 00:46:46,"['not_sur', 'want', 'major', 'context', '’_ll', 'sophomor', 'colleg', 'next_year', 'right_now', 'public', 'affair', 'major', 'think', 'doubl', 'major', 'psych', 'reason', 'chose', 'public', 'affair', 'feel_lik', 'career', 'work', 'government/publ', 'polici', 'give', 'opportun', 'realli', 'make', 'differ', 'root', 'problem', 'like', 'help', 'chang', 'structur', 'societi', 'make', 'sens', 'help', 'wide', 'amount_of', 'peopl', 'feel_lik', 'major', 'aren_’', 'necessarili', 'also', 'found', 'compar', 'govern', 'class', 'interest', 'high_school', 'would', 'like', 'work', 'food', 'polici', 'healthcar', 'polici', 'psych', 'extrem', 'interested_in', 'social', 'norm', 'psych', 'interest', 'anyway', 'want', 'doubl', 'major', 'public', 'affair', 'didn_’', 'feel', 'interest', 'fulfil', 'current', 'public', 'affair', 'major', 'seem', 'like', 'major', 'truli', 'help', 'make', 'differ', 'found', 'class', 'interest', 'high_school', 'somehow', 'class', 'interest', 'colleg', 'one', 'major', 'consid', 'health', 'promot', 'nutrit', 'exercis', 'scienc', 'philosophi', 'polit', 'econom', 'public', 'health', 'psych/sociolog', 'doubt', 'public', 'affair', 'polit', 'seem', 'overli', 'beraucrat', 'well', 'polit', 'mention', 'extrem', 'polar', 'atmospher', 'mayb', 'like', 'public', 'affair', 'us-focused…']","[(5, 2), (36, 2), (38, 1), (43, 1), (57, 1), (103, 3), (108, 1), (111, 2), (121, 1), (135, 2), (136, 1), (144, 3), (182, 1), (183, 1), (194, 3), (196, 4), (204, 1), (209, 1), (224, 1), (229, 1), (237, 2), (245, 1), (264, 1), (275, 2), (284, 1), (318, 2), (339, 1), (373, 8), (380, 1), (381, 1), (388, 1), (405, 1), (416, 1), (428, 1), (445, 1), (483, 1), (485, 1), (488, 2), (510, 1), (517, 1), (519, 2), (524, 1), (547, 1), (551, 1), (554, 2), (568, 5), (642, 1), (651, 3), (690, 2), (698, 1), (740, 1), (749, 3), (768, 1), (806, 1), (820, 1), (854, 1), (857, 1), (891, 7), (941, 1), (955, 3), (984, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

i am a 24 year old australian who is looking to move overseas on a gap year, and am looking to focus on relaxing with a bit of adventure. does anyone have any suggestions for things to do? i have heard of people doing a ski season and working there, but am not sure if it is worth it. i have also heard of people just traveling europe but am not sure if it is a little bit too expensive. i am also into sports and would love to improve my surfing ability or any other skill as long as it involves being active. 



any and all responses will be very much appreciated, i have no preferences to countries and am very open to any suggestions. 

for those that have done a gap year what was your experience? if if you had the time back what would you do different?

i was happy to help them a while ago since i like discussing academic-related stuff, but recently it’s just too much.

a while ago they always said “thanks” or at least showed a bit of gratitude. recently, i never heard of “thanks” or even a sign of thankfulness, and they don’t even respond to my messages (explaining the questions they asked) while left read.

sometimes they even get pissed off since i study with other people (i kind of ducked them since they constantly ruined my focus)

it is too time-consuming and does not benefit me in any way.

hey everyone! i'm at a crossroads trying to choose between several universities for my undergrad in public policy and could really use your help. 

i’ve got offers from university of bristol, indiana university bloomington, university of york, and university of toronto. each has its own vibe, but i need your take on a few things:

1. education quality - who's got the best program?

2. city life - where will i never get bored?

3. student experience - what’s the social scene and campus culture like?

4. international perspective - any advice for an international student in these places?

i’m all about finding a balance—great academics paired with a lively, fun city. which uni would you recommend and why? any insights on the lifestyle, local culture, or public policy approach in these countries would be super helpful.

what you should plan on is having skills and getting your first job. from there you just stumble on. data analysis and being able to use applications effectively is still very important and valuable.


you are waay waaay more likely to lose a job due to c levels being greedy, acqusitions and mergers, or offshoring than you are to lose it to ai in any job (other than writing and artists who are getting wrecked by ai now).

 accountants and finance people aren't being replaced by ai (i know many). people still value human brainpower in many places. yes this could change and probably is changing right now somewhat but you literally cannot do anything about that. everything about the way society works could change. i'm sorry if i am giving you an existential crisis, but life is kinda like that. you just keep on going and adapt. you will not graduate with something that is ""100%"" useless.

most people do not work in the field of their major. most people, you ask them,will tell you they have no idea how they made it ""this far"" in life. you think they are just being humble? as a 42 year old, nope. this is the truth. you just wake up, make small decisions daily and bam you ""end up"" with some wildly different life than you thought you would.

life has a way of just throwing you for loops despite your plans. 

for all you know you'll end up working in ai in the future. 

don't worry about ai. worry about the randomness of life.

check my weird path out:  undergrad: photography and poliical science. grad: creative writing in fiction. current job: owner of a toy store. previois job: video game designer. not to mention how i ended up getting married and living where i do now. i couldn't have predicted or imagined any of it. 

take the opportunities you get. breathe. we are all in a fog of war stumbling through. all of us. even the ones who look like they got their shit together run into situations they are not prepared for or knowledegable about.

being an adult is knowing you don't know everything, can't control everything and are willing to ask for help and advice when you are in the dark. this is why mechanics, accountants, lawyers, finance people, and market analysis folks are valuable. they are the ones the rest of us go to when we are in the dark and need help. this is why they are valuable. i would absolutely lose my shit if any of them somehow switched to ai. maybe they will in the future but i am certainly not living my life with that contingency in the forefront of my mind or letting it affect my daily life.

artists and writers of all kinds, i think, are the ones genuinely getting decimated by ai at this moment and it is a real problem for them

this days i feel pressured because i dont know if i should stay being in nursing field or be impractical and pursue medical school and do what i really desires. i mean i like being a nurse too but its just that i feel more excited to be a doctor than that of a nurse.

and in education: they are severely underpaid, some students can be rude and deemed as ""unteachable"" (which isn't a big deal imo) and if i did the 10 month paycheck i'd have to get a summer job (i probably would anyways) and if i did the 12 month paycheck i would get less throughout the year then the 10 month

seeing how you have some similar circumstances, discuss it with your parents. see what their expectations are. for me, it was start paying rent once i graduate and land a job asap. if you have some more support, use that and save up. many people take loans so they can afford college, so don’t feel bad. they say turn to fafsa, i say turn to your state as well. i was able to get some grants from them that fafsa didn’t, it was great! and don’t feel bad about cc either. you can always transfer and it saved me tens of thousands.get involved, enjoy it, and don’t let a relationship hold you back!!! that’s what i did and lost that, as well as the time i waisted putting my future in it.

so, my regrets were letting people hold me back of who i could be. my ex, my parents, and myself. don’t do that. and don’t let me, this was my experience and yours can be different.",2024-04-21 14:26:04,"['regret', 'like', 'save', 'careless', 'money', 'context', 'didn_’', 'think', 'colleg', 'didn_’', 'know_what', 'want', 'my_par', 'didn_’', 'plan', 'encourag', 'go', 'straight', 'workforc', 'continu', 'educ', 'think', 'back', 'blindsid', 'consid', 'option', 'futur', 'tradit', 'hear', 'enough', 'time', 'work', 'less', 'prepar', 'sahm', 'love', 'need', 'place', '’_ll', 'take', 'time', 'see', 'similar', 'circumst', 'discuss', 'your_par', 'expect', 'stapay', 'rent', 'graduat', 'land', 'asap', 'support', 'save', 'mani', 'peopl', 'take', 'loan', 'afford', 'colleg', 'don_’', 'feel', 'turn', 'fafsa', 'turn', 'state', 'as_wel', 'able_to', 'grant', 'fafsa', 'didn_’', 'great', 'don_’', 'feel', 'either', 'alway', 'transfer', 'save', 'ten', 'thousands.get', 'involv', 'enjoy', 'don_’', 'relationship', 'hold', 'back', 'lost', 'as_wel', 'time', 'waist', 'put', 'futur', 'regret', 'let', 'peopl', 'hold', 'back', 'could', 'my_par', 'don_’', 'don_’', 'experi', 'differ']","[(5, 2), (9, 2), (19, 1), (23, 1), (30, 3), (32, 1), (35, 3), (36, 1), (49, 1), (53, 1), (59, 3), (63, 1), (68, 1), (78, 2), (86, 1), (92, 1), (97, 1), (108, 2), (113, 1), (135, 1), (139, 1), (145, 2), (159, 1), (162, 1), (176, 1), (177, 1), (192, 1), (196, 1), (225, 1), (229, 2), (280, 1), (284, 1), (290, 1), (310, 5), (312, 1), (318, 1), (328, 1), (338, 1), (354, 1), (376, 1), (380, 1), (388, 2), (413, 2), (420, 1), (435, 1), (445, 1), (461, 1), (464, 2), (465, 2), (485, 4), (487, 1), (496, 1), (499, 1), (523, 1), (531, 2), (534, 1), (560, 1), (574, 1), (615, 1), (645, 1), (691, 1), (696, 1), (819, 2), (844, 1), (924, 1), (935, 1), (953, 1), (970, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

heres a long-term suggestion:  get your nursing degree.  work 5 years in your preferred specialty.  then go back and do a 2 year degree (only 2 because you already have a degree) and become a nursing instructor.

background: i am currently in my last year at university taking up accounting with a concentration in data analytics. for the last 3 years of my university my internship varied from being a data analyst, finance intern and accounting intern. as i approach my last year i started developing genuine interest in real estate and what really got me hook was just honestly hearing some of my friends talk about how deals are so complex, how there are so much things you need to account for when you start a project and more. i know it seems pretty shallow but just knowing how there are so many things to learn in real estate genuinely piqued my interest. i have started watching a lot of video on the fundamentals of real estate truthfully i would say my understanding level is a complete beginner but i have been watching and trying to understand more about it!

so now, i have a final interview coming up for the finance and acquisition analyst role and i am genuinely terrified because i do not have any experiences with real estate, i havent taken any offcial classes in re. all the knowledge i have are from youtube/linked videos. one of the last questions i asked the recruiting manager was how do i standout in the interview and she said something that worried me which was most of my internships are just related to accounting. 

so my big question is how do i differentiate myself from other applicants when i do not have any real estate background?

thank you for reading sorry if it was a tough one.

i like a good mix, which is why i love my community college that lets me take both, mine are 7 week ones so we do 2 the first term and 2 the second term, and i’ve found i prefer to take an in person and an online each term. the in person gets me out of the house for something other than work twice a week and gets those days started early, and the online gives me more flexibility in when i get my homework and studying done.

i also think i did better academically when i took online classes my senior year during quarantine (high school class of ‘21), i felt like had much more time to do my schoolwork without spending time going to the school and dragging myself to a different classroom every hour, i could sleep in a bit later, and i found that one of my issues is that i hate handwriting things so the assignments being all online helped me out. i don’t know if i could have handled 3 ap classes if i had been in person because being forced to get my organizational and time management skills together for all my classes when they went online to keep my head up in them is what allowed me to stay on top of the workload for my aps in a way i hadn’t for my classes in previous years. 

i have adhd so i’m naturally disorganized, but i have to keep an in depth task management system for my life or everything falls apart, and online classes during quarantine are really what taught me those skills, and i still use the same system 3 years into college. i know it definitely isn’t the same for everyone but i personally do better when i’m not fully in-person.",2024-04-21 15:47:44,"['adhd', 'agre', 'aren_’', 'person', 'like', 'good', 'love', 'community_colleg', 'let', 'take', 'mine', 'week', 'one', 'first', 'term', 'second', 'term', '’_ve', 'found', 'prefer', 'take', 'person', 'onlin', 'term', 'person', 'get', 'hous', 'someth', 'work', 'twice', 'week', 'get', 'day', 'start', 'earli', 'onlin', 'give', 'flexibl', 'homework', 'studi', 'done', 'also', 'think', 'better', 'academ', 'took', 'online_class', 'senior', 'year', 'quarantin', 'high_school', 'class', 'felt', 'like', 'much', 'time', 'schoolwork', 'without', 'spend', 'time', 'go', 'school', 'drag', 'differ', 'classroom', 'everi', 'hour', 'could', 'sleep', 'later', 'found', 'issu', 'hate', 'handwrit', 'thing', 'assign', 'onlin', 'help', 'don_’', 'know', 'could', 'handl', 'class', 'person', 'forc', 'organiz', 'time', 'manag', 'skill', 'togeth', 'class', 'went', 'onlin', 'keep', 'head', 'allow', 'stay', 'workload', 'class', 'previou', 'year', 'adhd', 'natur', 'disorgan', 'keep', 'depth', 'task', 'manag', 'system', 'life', 'everyth', 'fall', 'apart', 'online_class', 'quarantin', 'realli', 'taught', 'skill', 'still', 'the_sam', 'system', 'year', 'colleg', 'know', 'definit', 'isn_’', 'the_sam', 'everyon', 'person', 'better', 'fulli', 'in-person']","[(5, 1), (11, 1), (31, 1), (35, 3), (37, 3), (57, 1), (61, 1), (76, 1), (78, 2), (82, 1), (83, 1), (103, 4), (111, 2), (113, 1), (114, 1), (124, 1), (126, 1), (134, 2), (135, 1), (139, 2), (149, 1), (154, 2), (165, 1), (166, 1), (182, 1), (186, 1), (187, 1), (188, 1), (194, 1), (196, 2), (204, 1), (207, 1), (211, 1), (229, 1), (236, 4), (252, 2), (257, 1), (259, 1), (263, 1), (271, 2), (275, 1), (282, 5), (285, 1), (308, 1), (310, 1), (311, 1), (314, 1), (318, 1), (322, 3), (326, 1), (334, 1), (343, 1), (371, 2), (377, 2), (381, 1), (399, 1), (424, 1), (427, 1), (429, 1), (450, 1), (451, 1), (469, 1), (478, 1), (503, 2), (520, 1), (522, 1), (523, 1), (532, 2), (537, 1), (571, 1), (628, 1), (630, 1), (631, 1), (643, 1), (668, 1), (671, 1), (694, 1), (698, 1), (711, 1), (731, 1), (813, 2), (844, 1), (863, 2), (902, 1), (910, 1), (938, 1), (961, 1), (964, 1), (974, 2), (986, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

also, joining a junior college will allow you to meet with a counselor for guidance, some academic direction, without breaking the bank. tuition for in state resident students are very low and it is a great education. i recommend you to have fun taking courses that you are interested in.

i have just been doubting things a little bit and am not sure if i am totally set on what i planned to do (clinical/counselling). 

i have been considering doing a double major in political science/public policy because that was my second choice in terms of major. 

it’s just i have been kind of hesitant because i have a $20 000 scholarship to pursue undergraduate psychology and i don’t really want to lose that. plus, my gpa last term was really great. 3.94 overall and 4.0 in my psych classes. i have lots of experience in the mental health field and love what i’m doing. 

i’m just wondering if i end up changing my mind, is it possible for me to do a masters in public policy or mph if i wanted to? 

i’m not sure if i really want to double major as it might not really be worth the extra time and money. my school does have a mental health policy minor though, so i’m thinking about pursuing that instead! 

i know that i’m already halfway through my degree, but i’d rather have doubts and ask questions now rather than later. 

any advice or suggestions would be appreciated! thank you!!

i'm a college **freshman** at a **cuny school** (it's the one that mostly consists of finance majors, iykyk).

first let me start off with this: **i was accepted into nyu and fordham but could not afford it.** i went to boarding high school (with a hefty scholarship) where several of my close friends went to private institutions costing $50k+. since we were all super close, i allowed myself to believe i was ""one of them"" and also applied to these school with huge tuitions, not knowing i couldn't afford them. i also live with my high school sweetheart who goes to one of these ""expensive"" schools &amp; has their own place, so i'm getting a huge chunk off of my tuition already. anyways, **ninth grade me though i was gonna be at harvard or columbia,** and now i'm having a hard time ""coping"" with failing to achieve my biggest goals as a teen. it almost feels like i'm losing hope in myself. ***how did y'all cope?***

also!!!! **i'm a finance major** **but seriously don't know anything about finance.** like, not even a *rich dad poor dad* level of understanding, however, i like to believe that i can change that. how can i ""catch up"" in order to make the most out of my time in this finance school? ***finance majors: where did you start?*** do you have anything that really helped y'all progress in the finance world? whether it's harvard lectures, finance books for dummies, news subscriptions, or something like volunteering, i'm willing to learn as much as i can about finance in order to get ahead.",2024-04-21 17:34:53,"[""y'all"", 'colleg', 'freshman', 'cuni', 'school', ""it_'"", 'mostli', 'consist', 'financ', 'major', 'iykyk', 'first', 'staoff', 'accept', 'fordham', 'could', 'afford', 'went', 'board', 'high_school', 'hefti', 'scholarship', 'sever', 'close', 'friend', 'went', 'privat', 'institut', 'cost', '50k+', 'sinc', 'super', 'close', 'allow', 'believ', 'also', 'appli', 'school', 'huge', 'tuition', 'know', 'could', 'afford', 'also', 'live', 'high_school', 'sweetheawho', 'goe', 'expens', 'school', '&_amp', 'their_own', 'place', 'get', 'huge', 'chunk', 'tuition', 'alreadi', 'anyway', 'ninth', 'grade', 'though', 'gon_na', 'harvard', 'columbia', 'hard', 'time', 'cope', 'fail', 'achiev', 'biggest', 'goal', 'teen', 'almost', 'feel', 'like', 'lose', 'hope', ""y'all"", 'cope', 'also', 'financ', 'major', 'serious', ""do_n't"", 'know', 'anyth', 'financ', 'like', 'even', 'rich', 'poor', 'level', 'understand', 'howev', 'like', 'believ', 'chang', 'catch', 'order', 'make', 'time', 'financ', 'school', 'financ', 'major', 'start', 'anyth', 'realli', 'help', ""y'all"", 'progress', 'financ', 'world', 'whether', ""it_'"", 'harvard', 'lectur', 'financ', 'book', 'dummi', 'news', 'subscript', 'someth', 'like', 'volunt', 'will', 'learn', 'much', 'financ', 'order', 'ahead']","[(5, 1), (11, 1), (31, 4), (35, 2), (38, 1), (57, 3), (62, 1), (76, 1), (84, 1), (89, 1), (91, 1), (97, 2), (107, 1), (108, 1), (112, 1), (122, 1), (129, 1), (132, 1), (139, 2), (144, 1), (149, 1), (154, 1), (165, 1), (171, 1), (182, 1), (184, 1), (187, 2), (189, 1), (193, 1), (194, 1), (195, 2), (196, 4), (199, 2), (203, 1), (225, 1), (235, 1), (242, 1), (252, 2), (254, 1), (263, 1), (266, 2), (275, 2), (279, 1), (303, 2), (316, 1), (320, 1), (346, 1), (347, 1), (368, 1), (373, 3), (382, 1), (395, 1), (409, 1), (422, 1), (428, 1), (444, 2), (448, 1), (453, 2), (458, 1), (460, 1), (466, 1), (501, 1), (507, 1), (508, 8), (511, 1), (538, 1), (618, 1), (678, 1), (721, 1), (739, 1), (741, 1), (871, 1), (877, 1), (893, 2), (903, 1), (915, 1), (950, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

i completed my ba from one of canada’s top universities with honours, and went on to complete a master’s in political science, also with honours, at the second top ranked school in canada. 

but that was the end. i was motivated, always had been. but then reality set in. i had studied a subject that got me nowhere. i was educated, capable of research, able to write. i was so confident in my abilities, but i had nothing to show for it in the workforce. 

i bounced around retail jobs for a while, always staying on top of my resume and applying for entry level analyst jobs and internships. yet i never got anywhere. i eventually settled into car sales, which is where i am now. i’m almost 30, and carry close to $70k in student debt. the money i make is okay, but i never saw myself here. i look at my colleagues, people who have been in the industry since they were 18, and they’re masters of their craft. they have been making 6 figures for their whole adult life, and i’m hamstrung by my loans and wasted time. 

if i had just not gone to university and threw myself into work, i feel as though i would be so much further ahead in life. maybe i could have afforded a home by now, who knows. 

i’ve all but given up on ever using my degrees for anything. i’ve accepted it was the biggest mistake of my life, a mistake i’ll be financially making up for for the foreseeable future. it depresses me that i actually believed that studying a social science would actually get my somewhere. i wish i could tell the younger version of myself to not listen to what society was telling me, that pursuing your dream was the right choice. it wasn’t. it got me nothing. so for the rest of my days i’ll be peddling cars to sub-prime customers and trying to scrape by while paying thousands for something i wish i could return and take back.

dating 1.5m . i'm 19 f and 19 m. i really like my boyfriend however i can feel awkward and worry alot as i can get a horrible stomach ache which leaves me with acid reflux and feeling drained for no reason. it's either anxiety, sign we aren't for eachother or something else like danger. i need advice. i'd like to continue seeing him and seeing if it goes away and i love him or if it gets worst and i feel so sick constantly. i don't want to lead him in to ive told him many times about this. this is my first relationship. i'm just looking for comfort and ease in relationship however i can feel so sick i might throw up. he's a super lovely guy and we click in many things however i think my brain obsessed over bad things like at dinner we get tired and drained and so he goes in his phone for a bit. i thought like shit that rude and i worried and spiraled into this isn't normal. we should have so much to talk about. another thing is he is more spontaneous than me and better looking. he cheeky and makes sex noises in public and wants to chat up random people in street. i find this very embarrassing and don't like it. i tell him in jokey way but don't want to change him but i'll obsess over this as i'll think we aren't compatible. i'm too boring and he's too immature. he's had a long term relationship before too so he has more experience than he.i feel drained with his sometimes after couple hours or days straight together and i worry that's not normal as his my partner. also i see men of s similar age and i'll think like oh he is cute and i worry like shit that's bad if me to think that. i wouldn't want to have relationship or anything but find them cute. is this bad sign? 
he makes me feel good tho and when we hold hands or kiss i feel this lovely, buzzing holden energy.
however i'll then think that's just because i've never done this before and i worry i'll never fall in love with him as i overthink everything and don't get attached to people much. 
also what do you do in relationship. what's good deep questions to ask.
can i get advice on what to do? how should i deal with my doubts and obsessing over differences? i think i have stomach ulcers too. i get scared incase down the line i don't like him but i'm trapped and that feels horrible. 
basically i like him(don't live him yet atleast) and worry as this is first relationship so have low hopes. i'm new to all romantic things and get scared of everything it entails.

while talking, we talked about relationships and i found out that he was bi and i told him that i was gay. however, i told him that i'm in a relationship. he was happy for me and congratulated me. after meeting up with him, i got his snap and started a streak. ever since then, i talked to him about meeting up again, he agreed. the only issue i'd that he doesn't put in effort for making plans since he claims that he ""is really bad at making plans."" i did not really care since i usually make plans with friends regardless. within the last few weeks, i've brought up hanging out and getting food or something, but he seems to be busy. 
likewise with making plans, i usually engage the conversations on snap. we both are majoring in different things, so we never cross paths on campus. with that said, talking to him in person has not been achieved. while texting, he always gives me short responses. 
overall im debating if i should just drop making plans with him and keep him as a streak buddy, or if i should keep on trying. my theory is that he knew i was gay, cause it is kind of obvious, but lost interest in me after i told him i was dating someone. while he is always busy, he did mention to me that he has some work problems with management and has to work 50 hours a week along with school.

all i did in college was smoke a bunch of pot to be honest, and in reality i loved the fact that i attended college because i made so many friends (even though they were temporary relationships for the most part) and had so much fun and also discovered lsd in college.

my college tuition was literally around 200k and i only decided to attend because they gave me a significant amount in scholarships, which was kind of a surprise to me. i wish i had a chance to re-write my college essay because if i had written it now (as a 32 year old) i think i might have gotten more.

after exploring myself and going through an office job or two over the course of 8 years, i have finally started my own business and very precise skills that i learned in college are coming into fruition. i had absolutely no interest in pursuing an art career after college was over, but ultimately my business interests led me to do the work that i just happened to learn thoroughly in college.

at the end of the day even if you just dilly-dally in college, chances are you will pick up on the basics, and these basics are helping me so much with my current business that i am starting for myself.

don't read the entire textbook, i usually skim the assigned reading, make sure i understand the diagrams + equations super well and then actually read the summary of the chapter. then as i do the homework i dive deeper into the chapter to look for the concepts to apply.


i usually write chapter summaries on a notecards for physics to really try and condense the information.


to study i go through old homeworks and class work, and make a practice problems page. usually odd numbered problems from the textbook. as i do practice problems i identify what i'm struggling with and watch youtube videos on the topic. rinse and repeat.",2024-04-21 21:56:00,"['physic', 'multivari', 'calc', ""they_'r"", 'practic', 'problem', 'heavi', 'hope', 'translat', 'conceptu', 'stuff', 'as_wel', ""do_n't"", 'read', 'entir', 'textbook', 'usual', 'skim', 'assign', 'read', 'make_sur', 'understand', 'diagram', 'equat', 'super', 'well', 'actual', 'read', 'summari', 'chapter', 'homework', 'dive', 'deeper', 'chapter', 'look', 'concept', 'appli', 'usual', 'write', 'chapter', 'summari', 'notecard', 'physic', 'realli', 'condens', 'inform', 'studi', 'homework', 'class', 'work', 'make', 'practic', 'problem', 'page', 'usual', 'number', 'problem', 'textbook', 'practic', 'problem', 'identifi', 'struggl', 'watch', 'youtub', 'video', 'topic', 'rins', 'repeat']","[(18, 1), (84, 1), (103, 1), (114, 2), (121, 4), (127, 1), (132, 1), (135, 1), (143, 1), (144, 1), (166, 1), (182, 1), (203, 1), (283, 1), (293, 1), (346, 1), (349, 2), (362, 1), (374, 1), (395, 1), (464, 1), (474, 1), (480, 3), (515, 1), (517, 1), (530, 1), (643, 1), (791, 3), (824, 3), (833, 1), (834, 1), (835, 1), (885, 1), (918, 1), (1002, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

i have an a in once class, c, d,  and an f. the f class is too far gone now and i should have withdrawn from that one too but i tried to commit to something i should have thought more about instead of listen to others options of that i can do it when i knew i couldn’t. now it’s too late to withdraw. 
 
i am a sahm and while i have support. but not enough. i never got child care for my 3 year old. that is my biggest issue now because he is so busy. 

anyways my mental health and my household load is just too much for me to handle so i focus on that way more than school and idk why. my fiancé is kinda weird and just wants us to have traditional husband wife roles, but i can’t do school and be that. i have a history of depression and anxiety and been on medication for a year and switched med ines too and i think my depression and anxiety is just getting worse i’m too the point here i don’t give af anymore and just want to drive off the road most days. 

i want to email my counselor but idk what to say. i’ve waged her time and my instructors and i didn’t mean too. my instructor has been extending due dates per my request for the last several weeks i just can’t ask her to do anymore and plus we met on zoom for an hour and came up with a plan that i completely ruined now i’m way to far behind i don’t even want to try.

 i was behind the supposed schedule of works. i pass the bare minimum assessments because i can't seem to find the right concept and design. although i survived until our midterm revalida with my floor plans, concepts, and site development plan, my consultant suggested to change my site with practical reasons which i see but it was so sudden. it was already half of the semester, i was barely keeping track with my works before midterms but the sudden site change fazed me and got me off the sched again. but i did find a new site after day(s) and did site analysis and revised some parts of my manuscript. and during holy week, i was thinking of the development plan and revising my floor plans (and this week we were supposed to be making a 3d model of our plans already). after the break i started modelling my design slowly but surely since my revit, sketchup, and enscape expired i had to find an alternative urgently. since i was restarting, i used revit to revise the plan as i go. 

as the weeks pass, there was no day that i had 6hrs of sleep nor did i miss a day without working on my thesis. but must i say, i am very disappointed with my work because i know that i can do better. and i did hope that i could finish my work on time. but alas, we're supposed to pass our boards and manuscript tomorrow with me still missing 5 more buildings, a site, revised manuscript, and a scale model. and i don't know how i'll say it to my parents that i can't graduate this year, that i fail to meet my own expectations, especially their's.

i recently checked my grade and found that i had a c, and that the highest grade i could end with is a b-. this is totally my fault, i thought we had optional discussion posts but they were actually graded, and labeled in the syllabus as such. i don’t really know how i convinced myself they weren’t graded, but i rarely did them.

this, coupled with my struggle in the regular assignments has me thinking i should ditch sociology as a major, i feel like no college will take me seriously seeing that i had a  c/b- in my major class. is it that serious? i don’t have good access to people educated on this topic so i am kinda clueless. 

tldr; have a c and could only end with a b- in my intro to sociology class. i wanted to major in it but am reconsidering because i’m worried no college will take me seriously(i want to transfer to get a bachelors after). am i doing to much or should i switch majors.",2024-04-21 23:09:00,"['access', 'free', 'colleg', 'high_school', 'graduat', 'cool', 'program', 'state', 'program', 'year', 'take', 'colleg', 'class', 'onlin', 'semest', 'attend', 'high_school', 'transit', 'full_tim', 'person', 'school', 'next_year', '’_ll', 'go', 'associ', 'degre', 'want', 'major', 'sociolog', 'inspir', 'class', 'current', 'take', 'intro', 'sociolog', 'recent', 'check', 'grade', 'found', 'highest', 'grade', 'could', 'total', 'fault', 'thought', 'option', 'discuss', 'post', 'actual', 'grade', 'label', 'syllabu', 'don_’', 'realli', 'know', 'convinc', 'grade', 'rare', 'coupl', 'struggl', 'regular', 'assign', 'think', 'ditch', 'sociolog', 'major', 'feel_lik', 'colleg', 'take', 'serious', 'see', 'c/b-', 'major', 'class', 'seriou', 'don_’', 'good', 'access', 'peopl', 'educ', 'topic', 'kinda', 'clueless', 'tldr', 'could', 'intro', 'sociolog', 'class', 'want', 'major', 'reconsid', 'worri', 'colleg', 'take', 'serious', 'want', 'transfer', 'bachelor', 'much', 'switch', 'major']","[(5, 4), (23, 1), (25, 1), (31, 1), (36, 3), (37, 1), (41, 1), (43, 1), (53, 1), (75, 1), (78, 4), (92, 1), (96, 2), (103, 4), (111, 1), (113, 1), (139, 2), (172, 1), (182, 1), (192, 1), (229, 1), (231, 1), (232, 1), (236, 1), (252, 1), (256, 1), (260, 1), (263, 1), (264, 1), (265, 1), (275, 2), (282, 1), (283, 1), (300, 1), (310, 2), (338, 1), (343, 1), (353, 1), (354, 1), (365, 2), (373, 5), (380, 1), (388, 1), (393, 1), (410, 1), (442, 1), (443, 1), (446, 1), (466, 4), (515, 1), (519, 1), (608, 1), (615, 1), (634, 1), (643, 1), (739, 2), (783, 1), (885, 1), (908, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

-2 psy electives  
-2 other electives (random not worth naming) 

how do i do this in 4 semesters, i’ve never taken more than one science in a semester. i’m like at a loss of words. i don’t even know if it’s worth graduating on time either because i plan to apply to pa school and wouldn’t want to wreck my gpa. but i’ll loose my scholarships once i hit 8 semesters at the school. is taking organic and anatomy and going 5 days a week (live 30 minutes away) going to make me want to die? i think so. would i be better pairing anatomy when i take bio chem and genetics in the fall of 25? or would it be better 5 days a week with organic for this fall. advice please!!

you can’t upskill? get additional training? 

i’ve worked with community college grads who have gone on to get bas, mas, and mbas while juggling kids and jobs. they take classes at night, bit by bit, after putting their kids to bed.

speaking of which, i just met with a former student of mine who fits this description last week. now i’m recruiting her to be my colleague to run a program at my university-but she has her own nonprofit so i’m not sure she has time! 
what was her initial major in cc? child development. she decided to pivot to tech. in her  late 30s.

i will try and break this down. 
you can apply online very easily, go on their website and fill out and online application for x college. typically they will not ask much regarding what you choose to study and such, but even if they do you can always change your major and such so dont feel forced to pick a subject and obligated to stick with it. 
the cost varies a lot. i recommend you try out a community college as it is much cheaper, especially if done online. you can get your tuition cost knocked down by applying for things like fafsa, scholarships and grants. colleges also help you with different types of loans. you can also go i to a degree that will pay itself off. you can go into something like hvac or any trade job that will often pay you to attend because it is in high demand. 
generally speaking most colleges will help you with this process especially counselors about the cost. there are financial aid offices and more, colleges typically walk you through this process but it would be a safe bet to start saving up a few grand. if you have a college in mind you can look up annual or semester expenses for that college.",2024-04-22 03:19:22,"['good', 'stabroth', 'don_’', 'embarrass', 'want', 'increas', 'educ', 'return', 'life', 'break', 'appli', 'onlin', 'easili', 'websit', 'fill', 'onlin', 'applic', 'colleg', 'typic', 'much', 'regard', 'choos', 'studi', 'even', 'alway', 'chang', 'major', 'dont', 'feel', 'forc', 'pick', 'subject', 'oblig', 'stick', 'cost', 'vari', 'a_lot', 'recommend', 'community_colleg', 'much', 'cheaper', 'especi', 'done', 'onlin', 'tuition', 'cost', 'knock', 'appli', 'thing', 'like', 'fafsa', 'scholarship', 'grant', 'colleg', 'also', 'help', 'differ', 'type', 'loan', 'also', 'degre', 'someth', 'like', 'hvac', 'trade', 'often', 'attend', 'high', 'demand', 'gener', 'speak', 'colleg', 'help', 'process', 'especi', 'counselor', 'cost', 'financial_aid', 'offic', 'colleg', 'typic', 'walk', 'process', 'would', 'safe', 'stasav', 'a_few', 'grand', 'colleg', 'mind', 'look', 'annual', 'semest', 'expens', 'colleg']","[(0, 1), (5, 6), (9, 1), (10, 1), (29, 1), (36, 1), (38, 1), (41, 1), (57, 2), (63, 1), (69, 1), (75, 1), (83, 1), (107, 1), (108, 1), (125, 1), (136, 1), (141, 1), (143, 1), (149, 1), (159, 1), (166, 1), (168, 1), (169, 1), (170, 1), (184, 1), (186, 1), (192, 1), (194, 2), (196, 2), (197, 1), (199, 1), (203, 2), (236, 3), (239, 1), (240, 1), (246, 1), (249, 1), (263, 2), (279, 3), (290, 1), (309, 1), (310, 1), (311, 1), (318, 1), (330, 2), (343, 1), (373, 1), (398, 1), (404, 1), (446, 1), (472, 1), (481, 1), (484, 1), (507, 1), (522, 1), (526, 1), (588, 2), (666, 2), (676, 1), (711, 1), (732, 1), (736, 1), (738, 1), (769, 1), (932, 1), (948, 1), (999, 1), (1006, 1)]",[0.01162791 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

the language isn’t easy at all and i manage to understand the lecture, but conversing in deep philosophical topics is a bit hard for me.

i always do and give my best even though i’m facing difficulties delivering my idea.

i was actually invited to join the team by a guy… i was really hesitant at first but everyone just made a group with those who sat next to them, so it would’ve been rude if i just stood up and went to another group.

the group consists of two girls, including me and three guys.

one guy and one girl kind of do care about my opinions and ideas and the rest just ignore them.

i’m so tired and annoyed that every-time i say something or suggest something it all just gets discarded and they guy with whatever they want to do, especially the other girl.

i have two incidents with her.

1) i sent my idea in the group chat with references, and asked then to check it so we can talk about it next time… next time came nobody checked it obv and then as she’s trying to search about the topic she find the same thing i did and brings it up as if it’s her idea, and keeps bragging about it. what i did? nothing… just ignored her and didn’t share my ideas from that moment.

2) the second one her and the other girl were discussing about today’s topic, they find some video on the internet shows everyone except me. i did look annoyed but ignored her and as soon as the class ended i left without saying anything.


i want a mature advice.

- i do kind of want to bring it up and send it in the group chat,especially pointing out what the girl did. but if i do, everyone would perceive me as the rude one and side with the other girl.

- or just ignore it and let them do all the work and not participate in anything anymore.


let me know if you have a better idea.. and it would be better if it was not stolen lolol

on top of this all, there was a situation that happened recently that made me question what the heck was going on. my friend and i had made an impromptu plan to head to the mall after a long day of studying, and we decided to invite gina as well. as soon as gina got there, she began to adjust our initial plan. she wanted us to go out of our way to do some returns, and she started saying how she didn’t really want to go to the mall because she had gone recently. my friend began to side with her, which is when i politely tried to suggest that we stay to the plan my friend and i had made initially. following that, she and my friend left to go make the returns, claiming they would meet with me at the mall as soon as they were done. fast forward to about an hour later, i was waiting at the mall, and the two still hadn’t arrived. when they did, i found out that gina has made the returns and decided to go to a thrift shop with my friend. 

what’s worse is through all this, gina has a seemingly kind and happy go lucky attitude, making it difficult to confront her behavior. on top of that, my friend gets into this state of completely listening to everything gina says. i’m honestly stuck, because my gut tells me something isn’t right since everything “on paper” seems to look great. any advice on how to deal with this?",2024-04-22 04:35:23,"['context', 'close', 'friend', 'friend', 'call', 'gina', 'semest', 'first', 'three', 'along', 'well', 'enough', 'hang', 'pretti', 'frequent', 'semest', 'howev', 'past', 'semest', 'notic', 'three', 'togeth', '’_ll', 'often', 'exclud', 'convers', 'pictur', 'focus_on', 'friend', 'didn_’', 'think', 'much', 'first', '’_ve', 'hung', 'gina', 'notic', 'first', 'could', 'understand', 'mayb', 'feel', 'awkward', 'around', 'doesn_’', 'know', 'includ', 'convers', 'sinc', 'howev', '’_ve', 'come', 'know', 'anoth', 'quit', 'well', 'make', 'feel_lik', 'behavior', 'border', 'littl', 'rude', 'feel_lik', 'goe', 'exclud', 'situat', 'happen', 'recent', 'made', 'question', 'heck', 'go', 'friend', 'made', 'impromptu', 'plan', 'head', 'mall', 'long', 'studi', 'decid', 'invit', 'gina', 'as_wel', 'soon', 'gina', 'began', 'adjust', 'initi', 'plan', 'want', 'return', 'start', 'say', 'didn_’', 'realli', 'want', 'mall', 'gone', 'recent', 'friend', 'began', 'side', 'polit', 'tri', 'suggest', 'stay', 'plan', 'friend', 'made', 'initi', 'follow', 'friend', 'left', 'make', 'return', 'claim', 'would', 'meet', 'mall', 'soon', 'done', 'fast', 'forward', 'hour', 'later', 'wait', 'mall', 'still', 'arriv', 'found', 'gina', 'made', 'return', 'decid', 'thrift', 'shop', 'friend', 'wors', 'gina', 'seemingli', 'kind', 'happi', 'lucki', 'attitud', 'make', 'difficult', 'confront', 'behavior', 'friend', 'get', 'state', 'complet', 'listen', 'everyth', 'gina', 'say', 'honestli', 'stuck', 'tell', 'someth', 'isn_’', 'right', 'sinc', 'everyth', 'paper', 'seem', 'look', 'great', 'any_advic', 'deal']","[(11, 3), (15, 1), (26, 1), (29, 3), (36, 2), (42, 1), (49, 3), (52, 1), (53, 1), (55, 1), (74, 2), (75, 3), (76, 1), (87, 1), (91, 2), (105, 1), (108, 1), (111, 1), (112, 9), (113, 1), (119, 2), (126, 1), (128, 1), (132, 1), (136, 1), (138, 1), (139, 1), (143, 1), (144, 3), (149, 1), (153, 1), (154, 1), (166, 1), (182, 1), (206, 1), (211, 2), (219, 2), (227, 1), (229, 1), (233, 1), (237, 1), (244, 1), (252, 2), (253, 1), (255, 4), (256, 2), (259, 1), (263, 1), (278, 1), (280, 1), (285, 1), (292, 1), (294, 1), (311, 1), (320, 1), (326, 2), (327, 1), (347, 2), (360, 1), (372, 1), (380, 1), (401, 1), (419, 1), (424, 1), (438, 2), (445, 1), (450, 1), (453, 1), (455, 1), (464, 1), (468, 1), (475, 1), (485, 2), (487, 1), (504, 1), (506, 1), (510, 1), (512, 1), (517, 2), (519, 2), (548, 1), (597, 1), (607, 1), (630, 1), (665, 1), (670, 1), (671, 1), (708, 2), (719, 1), (720, 1), (732, 1), (743, 1), (749, 1), (792, 1), (803, 1), (808, 1), (870, 2), (887, 2)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

i am whitewashed af and i grew up being the only hispanic in a classroom until highschool. i still can’t stand my college. especially if you want to be premed - good luck! it’s so exhausting hearing your white classmates have already shadowed multiple doctors and have internships ready to go bc their parents knew a guy who knew a guy. 

the professors genuinely try to be inclusive and the school gives the clubs a big budget … the students are just so micro racist. they love having a latina around when it’s time to eat but other than that nope. at least that’s my experience and the experience of all other poc i have spoken with on campus. this is specific to my campus obviously but you would seriously think it would be different in a progressive city. i guess not

i got lucky bc i found the loml freshman year. without him i don’t think i would’ve made it through sophomore year. i finally made my friend group and it’s other women of color. 

if you go to a pwi, don’t take it to heart if the white girls don’t go out of their way to hangout with you. highschool is forced interaction, forced friendships, etc. college is so open and you have to put effort into keeing friends, the micro aggressions seriously come through. i was roommates with a white girl sophomore year and we got along super well and never had any arguments. we had the same sleep schedule, cleaning schedule, etc. she’d always chat with me in our room but the second we weren’t roommates completely ignored my existence. i was so upset and cried because i felt like it was me but then i realized her whole social circle is just white girls. if i was blonde hair &amp; blue eyes it’s so likely i’d be in her group. 

i don’t mean this as absolutely don’t go to a pwi. just a cautionary tale. join black student union, hispanic student union, asian student union, etc. you can definitely find your people, it’s just gonna take more work",2024-04-22 05:06:03,"['latina', 'isol', 'school', 'small', 'progress', 'citi', 'micro', 'aggress', 'insan', 'races/ethnicit', 'stick', 'togeth', 'don_’', 'social', 'outsid', 'realli', 'freshman_year', 'black', 'girl', 'latina', 'asian', 'make', 'white', 'friend', 'year', 'notic', 'peopl', '’_re', 'ever', 'around', 'usual', 'race/ethn', 'whitewash', 'grew', 'hispan', 'classroom', 'highschool', 'still', 'stand', 'colleg', 'especi', 'want', 'preme', 'good_luck', 'exhaust', 'hear', 'white', 'classmat', 'alreadi', 'shadow', 'multipl', 'doctor', 'internship', 'readi', 'parent', 'knew', 'knew', 'professor', 'genuin', 'inclus', 'school', 'give', 'club', 'budget', 'student', 'micro', 'racist', 'love', 'latina', 'around', 'time', 'nope', 'at_least', 'experi', 'experi', 'spoken', 'on_campu', 'specif', 'campu', 'obvious', 'would', 'serious', 'think', 'would', 'differ', 'progress', 'citi', 'guess', 'lucki', 'found', 'loml', 'freshman_year', 'without', 'don_’', 'think', 'would', '’_ve', 'made', 'sophomor', 'year', 'final', 'made', 'friend', 'group', 'women', 'color', 'don_’', 'take', 'heaif', 'white', 'girl', 'don_’', 'hangout', 'highschool', 'forc', 'interact', 'forc', 'friendship', 'colleg', 'open', 'effointo', 'kee', 'friend', 'micro', 'aggress', 'serious', 'come', 'roommat', 'white', 'girl', 'sophomor', 'year', 'along', 'super', 'well', 'never', 'argument', 'the_sam', 'sleep', 'schedul', 'clean', 'schedul', 'alway', 'chat', 'room', 'second', 'roommat', 'complet', 'ignor', 'exist', 'upset', 'cri', 'felt', 'like', 'realiz', 'whole', 'social', 'circl', 'white', 'girl', 'blond', 'hair', '&_amp', 'blue', 'eye', 'like', 'group', 'don_’', 'mean', 'absolut', 'don_’', 'cautionari', 'tale', 'join', 'black', 'student', 'union', 'hispan', 'student', 'union', 'asian', 'student', 'union', 'definit', 'find', 'peopl', 'gon_na', 'take', 'work']","[(5, 2), (13, 1), (22, 1), (24, 1), (31, 2), (33, 4), (35, 1), (36, 1), (37, 3), (51, 2), (78, 2), (85, 2), (89, 2), (110, 1), (111, 1), (112, 3), (118, 1), (119, 1), (124, 1), (135, 1), (136, 3), (138, 1), (144, 1), (153, 2), (156, 1), (179, 1), (182, 1), (188, 1), (193, 1), (196, 2), (204, 1), (208, 1), (211, 1), (217, 1), (229, 2), (242, 1), (244, 1), (247, 1), (255, 2), (259, 1), (271, 1), (287, 1), (290, 1), (292, 1), (310, 6), (316, 1), (318, 1), (328, 1), (336, 1), (339, 2), (346, 1), (364, 1), (385, 1), (388, 2), (399, 1), (429, 1), (440, 1), (480, 1), (489, 1), (492, 1), (513, 1), (517, 1), (520, 1), (521, 2), (523, 1), (536, 1), (558, 1), (561, 2), (565, 1), (588, 1), (603, 1), (613, 1), (630, 1), (632, 4), (660, 2), (668, 1), (696, 2), (703, 1), (707, 1), (711, 2), (713, 1), (716, 1), (739, 2), (742, 1), (758, 1), (764, 1), (770, 1), (772, 2), (779, 5), (782, 1), (810, 1), (873, 1), (882, 2), (900, 1), (925, 1), (941, 2), (944, 2), (948, 1), (954, 2), (976, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

i have an exam on wednesday, and something happened on sunday that’s left me mentally shocked and unable to focus on anything- in particular, it’s been difficult to study. i stared at a wall yesterday for 4 hours after what happened, and i couldn’t get a good night’s rest at all. i’ll try to keep what happened brief and somewhat vague.

my family has a business, and a tragedy occurred that’s a essentially rendered us without a source of income for the next 2-3 months. it made the local news because of how severe it was. no one died because we were closed, though, so this is why i’m worried this isn’t an acceptable reason (to professors) to be mentally unwell. i’ve never had to ask for an extension on anything before, so i really don’t know what’s ok and what’s not, or if i should be allowed some leeway.

i'm currently a senior in high school and i got into a direct-entry pa program this is great and all but i don't know if i should pursue this option. becoming a pa has been more of a recent thing as i only really found out about this profession in the middle to end of my junior year and i realized that this might be something i would enjoy studying in school for and pursuing a career in. in high school, i did enjoy science as a subject but i worry because of the general difficulty of the course. i'm afraid that if i were to go into this program i would maybe find out that this program isn't for me anymore and i would have to drop out or worse i would get kicked out for not being able to maintain the required gpa which is a 3.3. my other option is to go to a cuny major in anything(i haven't had a set major yet) and minor in prehealth and get all my prereqs done and if i were to find out that i can't do these high-level science classes or if i find out i don't want to become a pa anymore i can just simply change majors. to simplify how i see these choices the direct entry pa program as high risk, high reward, and the cuny option as a safer option for me. i don't know what to do as i feel like both choices heavily change my future.

i’ve been working at the same job for 14 years and make decent money. i have 39 credits from when i was 19 years old and i’m considering going back to finish my associates degree. 

obviously my first step is to reach out to the university and confirm that these credits are still valid since it has been 15 years. 
it would have no benefit to my current job and a deciding factor would be the cost of the schooling. 

another part of me was looking into getting my real estate license as my landlord recommended it. he’s known the owner of the property management company for 25 years and said she’s always looking for more competent workers and with my sales experience i could be a good fit as a property manager. 
the main reason this sounds good is that he said i’d be able to keep my current job and do this part time and only make the transition once i’m setup with consistency.

after working my last job for 17 years, the company i worked for sold so i decided to quit and go back to school. 

i reenrolled for the fall 23 semester, took one class to get a feel for things and got an a.

this semester, after i registered for classes i was informed i was on academic probation. there were two classes i thought i dropped that apparently weren’t. one of the classes isn’t offered anymore.

i have an a in both of the classes i am taking right now but my gpa will still be under 2.0 from the two non-dropped classes.

ive spoke to a counselor, academic probation, and am going to the college tomorrow morning to talk to admissions and records in the morning to see if i can have those two classes from 20 years ago removed.

i’m writing here to see if anybody knows if that’s even a thing schools do, given the amount of time that’s passed?

i feel dumb for not realizing those classes were hurting me. it was from such a long time ago that they don’t even show on my cc’s online profile.

admittedly, i didn’t do so well on the midterm and the midterm and final together = 50% of my final grade. anyways i have to get a 80% on my final with complete a marks for the rest of the semester (like 3 more weeks so it’s doable). i’m mostly concerned about the final because on a 30 question exam that would only leave me with 6 wrong choices. again it seems doable but it’s more risky than my alternative below:

my alternative option would be to withdraw from the course and retake it over the summer with a different potentially harder professor. however i could take more time to prepare and maybe get a better end grade. this choice as a result will leave me paying for the class this semester and a ‘w’ on my transcript.

should i just tough it out and go for the more risky option? or do i go the safe route and just ensure i can stay in the program with my scholarship (really good scholarship) and take a ‘w.’

my mother passed away when i was a teen and i don't have a good relationship with my father who lived out of state. i was told for years by my entire family, even by my own grandmother herself, that i was under legal guardianship as a child by my grandmother after my mother passed. well last week, i was sifting through a pile of old papers of my grandmother's and found out it was actually something else called an ""authorization agreement of voluntary nonparent caregiver w/ permission from my father"", which is apparently different and not guardianship. i think my family mistakenly thought it was the same thing, they seem very similar. this means that i was not an independent student like i thought i was the last two years, but rather dependent.

i contacted my school's financial aid office, explained the situation, and asked them if they could help me correct my last two fafsa's (22-23 and 23-24). however i was told that they are not interested in retroactively correcting older fafsa's and to just be correct going forward (24-25 and on). so basically, i most likely received and used a pell grant that by fafsa's criteria i may have not deserved. my college knows this now and is saying they're not going to worry about it and to move on.

that just...doesn't feel right though? do i really just ignore this? wouldn't the gov't department issuing these pell grants have an issue with that? i want to correct my mistake but i don't want to try to work this out alone and could use the school's help, or *someone's*. i'm the honest abe type even when it doesn't serve me, and i've been really stressing out about this.",2024-04-22 14:27:24,"[""it_'"", 'worth', 'turn', 'next', 'month', 'parent', 'inform', 'matter', 'go', 'forward', 'mother', 'pass', 'away', 'teen', ""do_n't"", 'good', 'relationship', 'father', 'live', 'state', 'told', 'year', 'entir', 'famili', 'even', 'grandmoth', 'legal', 'guardianship', 'child', 'grandmoth', 'mother', 'pass', 'well', 'last', 'week', 'sift', 'pile', 'paper', 'grandmoth', 'found', 'actual', 'someth', 'els', 'call', 'author', 'agreement', 'voluntari', 'nonpar', 'caregiv', 'permiss', 'father', 'appar', 'differ', 'guardianship', 'think', 'famili', 'mistakenli', 'thought', 'the_sam', 'thing', 'seem', 'similar', 'mean', 'independ', 'student', 'like', 'thought', 'last', 'two_year', 'rather', 'depend', 'contact', 'school', 'financial_aid', 'offic', 'explain', 'situat', 'ask', 'could', 'help', 'correct', 'last', 'fafsa', '22-23', '23-24', 'howev', 'told', 'interested_in', 'retroact', 'correct', 'older', 'fafsa', 'correct', 'go', 'forward', '24-25', 'basic', 'like', 'receiv', 'use', 'pell', 'grant', 'fafsa', 'criteria', 'deserv', 'colleg', 'know', 'say', ""they_'r"", 'go', 'worry_about', 'move', ""does_n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'though', 'realli', 'ignor', 'would', ""gov't"", 'depart', 'issu', 'pell', 'grant', 'issu', 'want', 'correct', 'mistak', ""do_n't"", 'want', 'work', 'alon', 'could', 'school', 'help', 'someon', 'honest', 'type', 'even', ""does_n't"", 'serv', ""'ve_been"", 'realli', 'stress']","[(5, 1), (6, 1), (9, 3), (10, 1), (18, 1), (24, 1), (31, 2), (33, 1), (36, 2), (37, 1), (42, 1), (44, 1), (52, 1), (53, 1), (58, 1), (63, 2), (67, 1), (69, 1), (70, 2), (72, 1), (74, 1), (84, 2), (88, 1), (95, 1), (107, 2), (108, 1), (111, 1), (113, 3), (117, 1), (129, 1), (134, 1), (135, 1), (136, 1), (139, 2), (142, 2), (149, 1), (155, 3), (170, 1), (179, 1), (182, 2), (186, 1), (194, 2), (195, 1), (196, 2), (198, 2), (208, 1), (213, 1), (222, 2), (227, 1), (229, 1), (230, 1), (237, 1), (252, 1), (254, 1), (262, 1), (271, 1), (283, 1), (298, 1), (300, 2), (307, 1), (308, 2), (318, 1), (343, 1), (345, 1), (347, 1), (348, 2), (362, 1), (369, 4), (384, 1), (392, 1), (407, 1), (413, 1), (420, 1), (432, 2), (434, 1), (479, 1), (494, 1), (517, 1), (528, 1), (547, 1), (574, 1), (601, 1), (635, 1), (658, 1), (704, 1), (706, 1), (719, 2), (792, 1), (918, 1), (966, 1), (990, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]
2586,t1_l0s14ny,1713810505.0,"back in the 1980s through maybe the late 1990s, the default degree for anybody who didn't have a plan was ""business administration"".  

business still isn't a bad idea today.  

but after the dot-com boom, computer science &amp; software engineering blew the heck up and are still all the rage.  

but not everyone wants such a hardcore technical education. it can feel too narrowly focused to some.  

today, ***in my opinion*** the degree that provides you with a foundation to access the most career options is **management information systems**.  

mis combines three core competencies:  

business administration  
computer science  
information technology  

this isn't a degree in how to create technology the way a cs degree is.  
nor is this a degree in how to create a tech startup the way a entrepreneurial degree would be.  

mis is all about how to solve business problems using technology solutions.  
you don't have to create the business, you just have to understand it.  
you don't have to create or support the technology, you just have to understand it's capabilities &amp; limitations.  

mis doesn't care what kind of a business or employment-entity you work for.  

medical research?  
investment banking?  
petroleum refinery?  
craft beer brewery?  
federal government entity?  

all of those operations have internal operational challenges that can be made better using one technology or another.  

an mis degree program will expose you to business &amp; economics, software, databases and infosecurity.  
if you suddenly realize any of those topics is ""your jam"" you are already on your way to understanding how to use whatever it is within an organization. so, now you can just fill some elective slots with deeper learning on that subject and you are on your way.

2590,t3_1caigkj,1713811019.0,"hi, i am just writing this because right now i am not sure what to do. i (f) am an english and creative writing major at a pretty large university. i am a freshman and this past semester i took a workshop on intermidete fiction. from the beginning i was the youngest person in the class made up of mostly juniors and seniors. i should also let you know that there are only about nine people in the class. as far as i am aware i am the only person in the class who has gone to the professors office hours and asked for extra help. everything three weeks i am asked to submit 20 pages of short fiction for the professor and the class to critique. this past week i was extensively proud of my work. i spent hours and hours writing and rewriting my work and submitted it four days before it was due. during class however, my professor (m) is supposed to give the class 25-30 minutes to critique my piece. without giving too many details (they would likely bore you) my professor saved my work until the last minute and barley said anything. the class, despite being energetic to critique everyone else's work, clearly had not read my piece. my professor told me that my main character was not fleshed out and had no information, i was confused because the first two pages of my piece are details of the main characters life, appearance, background, and thoughts. he also mentioned twice that he liked that my piece took place in 1942 (in the middle of ww2) when the piece states multiple times that it takes place in 1939 just before the war began to truly affect america. the one other student in my class who gave me feedback and seemed to have read my piece, told me it was strong and compared it to the boy who we critiqued before mine saying that i had similar dialogue but needed more physical details. my professor however, compared my piece to a girls who went two weeks before me who wrote a fanfiction about an anime that was so confusing to read the whole class asked her to rewrite. obviosuly i wasn't going to be an asshole and say mine was better but i sent this piece to my highschool english teacher and my grandfather who both said it was one of my best. after only ten minutes of crtitque where my professor basically told me to rewrite the entire thing, a student brought up taylor swift  and the professor quickly said ""i don't want to interrupt you girls discussing taylor swift"" and left the room. i was on the verge of tears. this has been a problem all semester of my professor not taking my work seriously and not reading it, despite reading every other males work. the feedback he left on my piece was two lines of the twenty pages that he underlined and said simply ""good historical context"" which feels very minimal for a professor who just asked me to rewrite the entire piece. long story short, it is clear that he did not read my piece, assumed it would be bad and half-assed my edits. my male counterparts piece had line edits on every paragraph and a detailed paragraph written on the end of his paper explaining what he did well and how he can improve. my professor has been rude all semester and once even took my phone out of my hand in class when i used it to check the time (my male counterpart next to me texts constantly and the professor never comments let alone takes his phone out of his hands.) i am not sure how to address this professor or confront him for not reading my work. i know i could just ignore this but i took this class because i genuinely want to be a writer and want feedback that can help me improve. i am sorry this is so long i did not intend it to be. any and all advice would be extremely appreciated thank you so much.",2024-04-22 14:36:59,"['write', 'right_now', 'not_sur',

basically, i’m conducting a case study on a bank and have conducted surveys and interviews on their customers, and now want to interview a representative of the bank to get their take on it. could be a teller, or a more senior rank. anyway, my problem is that i can’t gain access to them. despite very generous incentives and option to be anonymous, no one wishes to participate. the thesis would also not be published online either. obviously, i should’ve asked about this a long while ago, but i didn’t realize at the time that it’d be this difficult to find a respondent, and now i simply do not know what to do. this is the last data collection i need for the study and can’t really progress until i have found a willing participant. 

  
a lot of the questions that i’d be asking essentially carries the purpose of verifying the customers’ thoughts and to be honest, the answers in almost all cases are obvious. some are a bit ambiguous, and i think i could get a good understand by observing the tellers, and further i think i could generate some ‘i don’t know’ on the ones that i would be unsure about. 

  
so, with all this in mind, i’ve gotten to the point of fabricating this interview instead. i realize this is wrong and obviously unethical, but i just don’t know what else to do if i’m to finish it up this semester, if at all. but obviously i also wonder how this could backfire. i do wonder if the supervisors routinely force us to hand out contact information to respondents, even if their participation would be anonymous/anonymised?

if your school uses the css, it’s a guess. assume that a little is fine, a lot would impact it. 

either way, we are talking about your junior year financial aid when it comes to income (your sophomore year looks at 2022 taxes). of course, if you have $10k sitting in a savings account from working this summer when you fill out the fafsa in october, that could impact your 2025-2026 financial aid. assets matter, too. ",2024-04-22 17:29:00,"['not_sur', 'peopl', 'idea', 'depend', 'student', 'incom', 'isn_’', 'fafsa', 'carri', 'lower', 'weight', 'number', 'variabl', 'school', 'use', 'fafsa', 'would', 'depend', 'much', 'earn', 'summer', 'much', 'earn', 'total', 'year', '2024-2025', 'fafsa', 'count', 'first', '9,410', 'annual', 'student', 'incom', 'rais', 'student', 'index', 'formerli', 'expect', 'famili', 'contribut', 'amount', 'school', 'use', 'guess', 'assum', 'littl', 'fine', 'a_lot', 'would', 'impact', 'either', 'talk', 'junior', 'year', 'financial_aid', 'come', 'incom', 'sophomor', 'year', 'look', '2022', 'tax', 'cours', 'sit', 'save', 'account', 'work', 'summer', 'fill', 'fafsa', 'octob', 'could', 'impact', '2025-2026', 'financial_aid', 'asset', 'matter']","[(0, 1), (1, 1), (9, 4), (10, 2), (11, 1), (13, 1), (16, 3), (30, 1), (31, 2), (33, 3), (37, 3), (54, 1), (67, 1), (135, 1), (136, 2), (139, 1), (140, 1), (142, 1), (143, 1), (152, 1), (158, 1), (169, 1), (176, 1), (185, 1), (205, 1), (213, 2), (224, 1), (230, 2), (241, 1), (253, 1), (260, 1), (261, 2), (263, 2), (281, 2), (285, 1), (292, 1), (293, 1), (358, 2), (378, 1), (379, 1), (383, 1), (388, 1), (691, 1), (941, 1)]",[0.01612903 0.01612903 0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

how did that go? this would have given you some insight into how the professor acts away from a group. sometimes they're much more laid back when they don't have to deal with a whole class when speaking to you.

&gt;during class however, my professor (m) is supposed to give the class 25-30 minutes to critique my piece. without giving too many details (they would likely bore you) my professor saved my work until the last minute and barley said anything.

i've been in a lot of workshop classes like this. this happens all the time, regardless of gender or age. this is a time management and classroom management issue, especially because workshops are 90% discussion. they also tend to run long and people get distracted/antsy/tired.

20 pages per student is a lot. if you have, say, 3 people submitting stories each week, that's 60 pages (if no one goes over or doesn't use formatting that is difficult to read). it can be hard to keep up with. this is why it's better to establish rapport with your classmates and go to office hours so you have some connections beyond the workshop for future feedback.

is there a possibility that you're being treated unfairly? of course. before turning to the department chair/dean, though, consider if there is anything you can do to ask for better time management in the class, ask people if they can write down more notes for you to incorporate into your work (if they have time), try to have a clear but open-minded conversation about this over office hours, and so on. it's possible you're not the only one who feels this way, but you won't know until you start to communicate assertively and try not to put too much stock into anyone's opinion of you.",2024-04-22 17:49:06,"['&_gt', 'awar', 'person', 'class', 'gone', 'professor', 'office_hour', 'ask', 'extra', 'help', 'would', 'given', 'insight', 'professor', 'act', 'away_from', 'group', 'sometim', ""they_'r"", 'much', 'laid', 'back', ""do_n't"", 'deal', 'whole', 'class', 'speak', '&_gt', 'class', 'howev', 'professor', 'suppos', 'give', 'class', '25-30', 'minut', 'critiqu', 'piec', 'without', 'give', 'mani', 'detail', 'would', 'like', 'bore', 'professor', 'save', 'work', 'last', 'minut', 'barley', 'said', 'anyth', ""'ve_been"", 'a_lot', 'workshop', 'class', 'like', 'happen', 'time', 'regardless', 'gender', 'time', 'manag', 'classroom', 'manag', 'issu', 'especi', 'workshop', 'discuss', 'also', 'tend', 'long', 'peopl', 'distracted/antsy/tir', 'page', 'student', 'a_lot', 'peopl', 'submit', 'stori', 'week', 'page', 'goe', ""does_n't"", 'format', 'difficult', 'read', 'hard', 'keep', ""it_'"", 'better', 'establish', 'rappowith', 'classmat', 'office_hour', 'connect', 'beyond', 'workshop', 'futur', 'feedback', 'possibl', ""you_'r"", 'treat', 'unfairli', 'cours', 'turn', 'depart', 'chair/dean', 'though', 'consid', 'anyth', 'better', 'time', 'manag', 'class', 'peopl', 'write', 'note', 'incorpor', 'work', 'time', 'clear', 'open-mind', 'convers', 'office_hour', ""it_'"", 'possibl', ""you_'r"", 'feel', ""wo_n't"", 'know', 'stato', 'commun', 'assert', 'too_much', 'stock', 'anyon', 'opinion']","[(0, 2), (12, 1), (30, 1), (33, 1), (34, 1), (35, 4), (44, 1), (57, 1), (58, 1), (59, 1), (73, 1), (77, 1), (84, 1), (86, 1), (95, 1), (103, 6), (105, 1), (108, 1), (125, 1), (129, 1), (134, 1), (135, 2), (136, 2), (147, 2), (155, 1), (173, 1), (188, 1), (194, 1), (195, 2), (196, 2), (200, 1), (202, 1), (204, 2), (222, 1), (252, 1), (263, 1), (282, 1), (284, 1), (303, 2), (308, 1), (315, 1), (317, 1), (320, 1), (327, 1), (332, 1), (347, 1), (360, 1), (362, 1), (370, 1), (371, 1), (377, 2), (378, 1), (388, 3), (413, 1), (456, 1), (465, 1), (473, 1), (474, 2), (501, 1), (506, 1), (530, 1), (532, 3), (539, 1), (548, 1), (558, 4), (586, 1), (587, 2), (588, 1), (595, 1), (600, 1), (615, 1), (616, 2), (638, 1), (655, 1), (660, 1), (668, 1), (703, 1), (708, 1), (724, 1), (760, 1), (794, 1), (824, 1), (839, 1), (856, 2), (886, 1), (900, 1), (907, 3), (909, 1)]",[0.01694915 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

2664,t3_1canxy9,1713824438.0,"hello! 

i'm a 19 year old studying physics (b. s.) i'm currently a freshmen aswell. 

for the past year, i've struggled heavily with academics. i've lost all motivation and joy when it comes to learning and the such. i didn't use to be this way, but for the last two years its been my norm. 

i went to a state university, and it's getting very difficult to pay. i have around 1k left in my 529, and 1800usd to pay off before the start of may. there's no way i can fully make that payment on time. i wish someone pulled me aside and told me that it it's okay to take a gap-year or go to community college. i really wish i had. 

i'll be finishing this year with a gpa around: 2.5-3.0. it's the lowest i've ever gotten before. i'm probably going to lose my scholarships, but i can appeal them starting fall 2024 if i take some summer classes and if i do well in them. 

i feel super miserable at the moment. even though i'm not depressed anymore, nothing feels worthwhile to me. i'm so afraid of having all these responsibilities dropped on me seemingly out of nowhere. it's stressing me out greatly. i wish i listened more when i was younger about these things.

my university forces freshmen to live on campus and heavily engage with the universety. we had to pay an extra half a grand for a mandatory ""saddle-up"" program. we have to live in these dorms that barely have functioning elevators, and it seems like nothing has been replaced since john. f kennedy has been in office. 

i work at the dining hall, and the food that we serve out is sometimes inedible. on one of my first shifts, half of the bags of hot dog buns were contaminated with mold. our supervisor cross-contaminated various areas, is trying to union-bust, talks mad shit to our chefs ""you're a terrible chef; that's why your restaurant failed."", and tons of other horrendous shit. keep in mind, i'm forced to buy a meal-plan, so that's hundreds of dollars that i could've saved otherwise. 

my physical checks from the university didn't even cash in because the security codes were misprinted and missing on my checks. 

i'm really done with this university. i feel like that they don't care about me at all, and that they only look at us in terms of numbers-for profit.

 not severe enough? you were impacted, that's severe enough. i know it's not helpful to hear, but i can't stand the fact that this is what the education system made you believe. the phrase 'there's no longer any evidence' indicates things that are deeply concerning. again, you are not obligated to elaborate or even read this.


 if you were my daughter (i have a few) i'd advise you to file a report because that's the only way anyone can possibly be held accountable.  if this professor used his position of power and authority to convince or force you to do anything, that's blatantly unethical and wrong. it's not on you. i'd be inclined to tell you to file the report and raise a ruckus with the college after you graduate if you are so inclined. 


consider making use of counseling services in accordance with your schedule and desire to address what's happened. you deserve to be happy, too.


 i'd also advise you to go to the commencement. don't let that bastard steal it from you if there's even a chance you'd regret it later. but that's hollow and trite as only you know if that's something you're up to, and anything i can say is ultimately 'go get 'em tiger!' i wish you luck and peace.

finding a grad program can feel overwhelming, i had around a 3.3 gpa, but i also was involved in a lab. therefore, you can supplement your lower gpa with experience. are you in a lab? you can cold email psych professors and see if they need help next semester? or even during the summer? if not look for a job as a behavioral technician at a hospital. i think the only way you figure out what you want to do in grad school (or career wise) is by trying to find someone you can shadow, and/or seeing if there is a psych lab that you can volunteer for. i know that seems scary, but you also need recommendations for grad school.

as a white person, the school wasn’t on my list but it is the most generous scholarship offer that i received (almost a full-ride with the requisite grades), and while i’m seriously considering it, i am conflicted about going. 

my parents and my so (18m) are advising me not to go because they think it might be a harder environment to adjust to and because it’s significantly farther than the other schools i was initially considering.

i looked it up and its student body is over 90% black. i personally don’t have any problem with that, but i think it’s a fair point to say that it might be a bit more of a cultural shock. 

one of my biggest goals/dreams is to continue playing at the collegiate level, and this opportunity would be by best chance of doing that. it’s also a d1 school which makes it all the more attractive to me.

hi all, i’ll get straight to the point. i have dyscalculia, and a very mild form of dyslexia. for many reasons i have chosen not to disclose this to my university/ not use accommodations. the biggest reason is because i have never benefited from accommodations, found them helpful, etc. if anything they would make me feel more stressed out. 

a professor made a comment on an assignment of mine on canvas (the class is statistics) where i had gotten two questions wrong on each attempt despite them saying i had it backwards. they made an additional comment on the assignment saying that “i should have this down by this point in the semester”. i wanted to offer up an explanation and told them i have the latter learning disabilities which impact me in x ways, and that i will try to do it again. 

my comment was purely to try and emphasize that i am not a lazy student, that i am just trying my best to understand which might not be clear from my attempts. now however i’m panicking thinking about how it might look bad that i said that and how they might think i am lying because i don’t have that on record for her class or with the university. can she or the university accuse me of lying/ require me to register my issues with the university?? i am absolutely spiraling right now. what do y’all think??

nowadays, folk having a college degree are ""only"" 60% more likely to be employed than folk without a hs diploma.

the college educated are more likely to be employed, and more likely to earn more; it's a no-brainer if you find yourself so inclined.

2806,t3_1cav8vy,1713844911.0,"my 2nd year of uni is almost finished and somehow i've made it this far. grades are not very good, not failing, but i really, genuinely wanted a lot better. this semester has also been the hardest for me so far, i even dropped a class and withdrew from another (that i will have to pay back). that leaves me with just 3 damn classes for the rest of this semester, and even then i still can't get enough done.

basically i just don't study enough. not even close. i procrastinate to no end and spend the entire day on my phone, at times literally with my hw ready to start right in front of me. i will go hours like this, from 2pm to 10pm, in the library, laptop and papers out and ready, without getting a single. thing. done. and that's the case for atleast 2/3rds of my days here. genuinely. it's ridiculous. 

i know college schoolwork is supposed to take up a decent chunk of your time. you're going to do terribly if you don't put atleast multiple hours in everyday. i really don't want to do terribly. i can't tell you how much i want to be getting as, or even as and bs. it seems like everyone else around me has it all figured out too, like they have it all on lock. i always see them studying for hours with no interruptions and no struggle. i just don't get it. it feels impossible for me.

i'm actually going to be taking a semester off after this summer due to this and a few other reasons. during this time i really need to figure out how to achieve some level of self discipline because i will fail college if i don't. i am actually getting tested for adhd this month (not even for these reasons directly but for others ones funny enough) so that may be helpful if i actually have it. although i feel i could easily just be a lazy, undisciplined person. i don't know.

my hs grades sucked senior year, but i still got into honors history and english because i rocked the act.

you should be fine and there's lots of reasons to do poor in hs. sucky teachers that don't like you, life drama, all sorts of things. mine was that i hated my hs and started just not giving a shit. horrible people. teachers that did not like me, and spending a lot of time exploring relationships, jobs, evetual independence,  etc and letting that take priority.

ds and cs still pass for hs, though. that's the important thing where you get the hs diploma.

you will still get in and most likely be able to dorm with your friend if they put all honors people into separate honors dorms. if not, so what? you will still get in. you'll just meet new people. which can be cool to a degree.

bear in mind, though about college.

college flunks out around half the people that attend it. more or less depending on what you get into. and there's a good chance what you think you want to go into, you will change your mind.

the good thing is unlike hs, it's not every single day. but it's a lot more compact  and if you don't keep on top, it sneaks up on you. especially if you are on your own with little oversight and let the party and dating scene or jobs get in the way. this is what happened to me my first attempt of college back in the day. partied, dated, worked till too many missing 8 am algebra classes and a string of fs and ds led to the end of my college career until decades later.",2024-04-23 01:25:19,"['honor', 'program', 'based_on', 'act/sat', 'score', 'necessarili', 'high_school', 'grade', 'suck', 'senior', 'year', 'still', 'honor', 'histori', 'english', 'rock', 'fine', 'lots_of', 'reason', 'poor', 'sucki', 'teacher', ""do_n't"", 'like', 'life', 'drama', 'sort', 'thing', 'mine', 'hate', 'start', 'give', 'shit', 'horribl', 'peopl', 'teacher', 'like', 'spend', 'a_lot', 'time', 'explor', 'relationship', 'job', 'evetu', 'independ', 'let', 'take', 'prioriti', 'still', 'pass', 'though', 'import', 'thing', 'diploma', 'still', 'like', 'be_abl', 'dorm', 'friend', 'honor', 'peopl', 'separ', 'honor', 'dorm', 'still', 'meet', 'peopl', 'cool', 'degre', 'bear', 'mind', 'though', 'colleg', 'colleg', 'flunk', 'around', 'half', 'peopl', 'attend', 'less', 'depending_on', 'good', 'chanc', 'think', 'want', 'chang', 'mind', 'good', 'thing', 'unlik', ""it_'"", 'everi', 'singl', ""it_'"", 'a_lot', 'compact', ""do_n't"", 'keep', 'sneak', 'especi', 'littl', 'oversight', 'parti', 'date', 'scene', 'job', 'happen', 'first', 'attempt', 'colleg', 'back', 'parti', 'date', 'work', 'till', 'mani', 'miss', 'algebra', 'class', 'string', 'colleg', 'career', 'decad', 'later']","[(0, 2), (5, 4), (11, 1), (35, 1), (36, 1), (37, 1), (38, 1), (41, 1), (59, 1), (76, 1), (78, 1), (84, 2), (86, 1), (87, 1), (99, 1), (103, 1), (112, 1), (129, 2), (135, 1), (148, 1), (153, 1), (158, 1), (162, 1), (186, 3), (195, 2), (196, 3), (197, 2), (204, 1), (209, 1), (229, 1), (253, 1), (257, 1), (259, 4), (262, 1), (274, 1), (275, 1), (314, 1), (343, 2), (348, 1), (360, 1), (361, 1), (365, 1), (371, 1), (386, 1), (388, 4), (411, 1), (424, 1), (439, 2), (446, 1), (454, 2), (466, 1), (469, 1), (483, 1), (522, 1), (524, 1), (573, 2), (574, 1), (582, 1), (588, 1), (590, 2), (608, 1), (662, 1), (663, 1), (672, 1), (702, 1), (731, 1), (750, 1), (753, 1), (793, 1), (798, 1), (801, 1), (844, 1), (847, 1), (910, 1), (915, 1), (930, 4), (945, 2), (975, 1), (985, 1)]",[0.01886792 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

another great way to look at this is to find a bachelor's degree you're interested in at a 4 year university you're interested in, find the course requirements online, then find credits at the cc that would transfer for their core/gen ed classes. both the uni and cc should have tools online showing credit equivalency.

a major is your main course of study. a minor is an add-on, usually a lot fewer classes, but isn't as significant as a major. kinda like pepperoni on your cheese pizza.

an associates degree is usually 60 credits worth of work, but a specific 60 credits. if you're transferring to a bachelor's program later, you don't have to finish the associates degree first.

prerequisites are merely classes you have to take before other classes. what a lot of people refer to as ""prereqs"" are better referred to as ""general education"" classes, ""geneds,"" or ""core classes."" think math, english, humanities, etc.

2895,t1_l0urg24,1713853601.0,"hey 👋 here’s the advice i received as someone who is visibly white, but is actually biracial (black/white mainly)

the rep said there has been white students who have joined and transferred over to a hbcu and they didn’t have any issues. they joined teams, clubs, and were accepted amongst their peers.

now, i will state this; 
with knowing that this is hbcu, i’d would be mindful of the history of the college and what it represents. be open to different viewpoints and perspectives. i’ll give you an example of a similar situation to yours;

have you heard of the university gallaudet university? it is university for the deaf and hard of hearing population in washington. while a large percentage of the student pop is d/hoh, they don’t deny the entrance of hearing students. they welcome them too. just be mindful of the environment, history, and culture (language) of the school you are going to serves a particular population historically and culturally. 

i’d say; if that school was aware of you being non-poc and still offered and gave you the scholarship, then they are saying you are welcomed to be there. in addition to what you said about the culture shock; well think of it for many poc (and by my example of d/hoh people) in the overall world and academic/ work environment. being exposed to the realities others face could be beneficial if you can recognize that. and well, again, others have been forced to do the exact same thing time and time again. 

as a biracial person, it might be easier for me to say this and might be harder for you to handle due to this. however, i will reenforce that they gave you the scholarship knowing who you are. don’t let people stop you cuz it may be uncomfortable (unless it crosses the line of being reasonable)- if you are ok and willing to be put in this situation and learn from a hbcu; then go and be open to learn",2024-04-23 02:26:41,"['advic', 'receiv', 'someone_who', 'visibl', 'white', 'actual', 'biraci', 'black/whit', 'mainli', 'said', 'has_been', 'white', 'student', 'join', 'transfer', 'hbcu', 'didn_’', 'issu', 'join', 'team', 'club', 'accept', 'amongst', 'peer', 'state', 'know', 'hbcu', 'would', 'mind', 'histori', 'colleg', 'repres', 'open', 'differ', 'viewpoint', 'perspect', '’_ll', 'give', 'exampl', 'similar', 'situat', 'heard', 'univers', 'gallaudet', 'univers', 'univers', 'deaf', 'hard', 'hear', 'popul', 'washington', 'larg', 'percentag', 'student', 'd/hoh', 'don_’', 'deni', 'entranc', 'hear', 'student', 'welcom', 'mind', 'environ', 'histori', 'cultur', 'languag', 'school', 'go', 'serv', 'particular', 'popul', 'histor', 'cultur', 'school', 'awar', 'non-poc', 'still', 'offer', 'gave', 'scholarship', 'say', 'welcom', 'addit', 'said', 'cultur', 'shock', 'well', 'think', 'mani', 'exampl', 'd/hoh', 'peopl', 'overal', 'world', 'academic/', 'work', 'environ', 'expos', 'realiti', 'other', 'face', 'could', 'benefici', 'recogn', 'well', 'other', 'forc', 'exact', 'thing', 'time', 'time', 'biraci', 'person', 'might', 'easier', 'might', 'harder', 'handl', 'howev', 'reenforc', 'gave', 'scholarship', 'know', 'don_’', 'peopl', 'stop', 'uncomfort', 'unless', 'cross', 'line', 'reason', 'will', 'situat', 'learn', 'hbcu', 'open', 'learn']","[(5, 1), (22, 2), (31, 2), (33, 3), (35, 2), (52, 2), (53, 1), (56, 1), (65, 1), (72, 1), (73, 2), (74, 1), (80, 1), (86, 1), (92, 1), (94, 3), (113, 1), (135, 1), (136, 1), (139, 1), (171, 1), (184, 2), (186, 1), (197, 2), (201, 1), (204, 1), (209, 1), (229, 1), (235, 2), (252, 2), (259, 1), (269, 1), (282, 1), (283, 1), (308, 1), (310, 2), (318, 1), (328, 2), (329, 2), (347, 1), (380, 1), (388, 2), (420, 1), (458, 1), (485, 1), (501, 1), (502, 1), (517, 2), (555, 1), (556, 1), (572, 2), (579, 1), (583, 1), (593, 1), (598, 1), (626, 2), (640, 1), (672, 2), (686, 1), (707, 1), (711, 1), (713, 2), (715, 1), (741, 1), (767, 1), (773, 2), (776, 1), (779, 2), (787, 1), (818, 2), (838, 1), (909, 1), (917, 1), (961, 1), (969, 1), (1001, 3)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

so, fws pays your employer to pay you.  this means anyone who can tap into this as a funds gets a huuuuuuuge budget increase.  they can now hire 4 employees instead of one.  or, they can offer quadruple the hours to one employee with the limits of 25 hour maximum per week during school weeks. but you probably aren't interested in the school side of it.

as a student it integrates you into a community who understand that your goal is school. the employer might truly believe in education as i do or they might just have to acknowledge that you have a set class schedule and a hard limit of 25 hours a week.  in my office, we use this as a way to encourage student workers to look at there syllabi and plan out accordingly.  when are your finals and big projects.  it provides a level of mentorship that can easily be lost in a large college like mine, particularly for first and second year students who might have large lecture hall classes.  similarly, a first generation student now has a support network of often recent graduates or young professionals to provide an example of where one could go (or where one might avoid).

it also creates a community of peers. people who can say to you ""take this class"" or ""don't take that class"" or ""yeah, my first year was super hard too, look out for finals week and let's party during spring break"".  this is so important, especially for students who are away from home or have few academic role models. there are studies that show your first semester tapping into fws your grades drop, but following semesters have an overall increase in scores compared to students who don't use fws. 

can these same benefits be obtained without fws? yes, clubs can provide the same type of resiliency through community.  so can integration into your field of study or (some) frat/sorority or tutoring groups.  so that leads to the next bit: government.

the government wants you to be a good student and a good employee.  the government isn't a monolith and this will mean different things to different parts of the government.  but the underlying tension in financial aid, imo, is the mix between exploitation and social production for education and labor.  the sap standards and loans is the tangent that comes to mind. to get the loan, you need to maintain your gpa, class rate, and not be in college to long.  on the other hand the cost of school raises to meet the available money supply and lenders see you as a money churn.  fws is the same, you have to maintain your grades and pace while it's also teaching you how to be a professional or not to miss shifts, often at minimum wage where the school is exploiting your labor.  this exploitation tension is also in the fact that socioeconomics define who has access to fws or who has the privilege not to need fws.  are we accidentally creating and reproducing an underclass through generational wealth? or are we providing resume experience and funding to chronically under served populations? is it both? 

i think i've gotten off topic. the purpose of federal work study is integration, reproduction, and providing grant funding with strings.  as a student, you get community and supporters.  the school gets an effectively low wage workforce.  the government provides additional incentives for you to keep grades and pace so you leave college and join the main labor market.",2024-04-23 02:51:00,"['realli', 'interest', 'socioeconom', 'love', 'think', 'pay', 'employ', 'mean', 'anyon', 'fund', 'get', 'huuuuuuug', 'budget', 'increas', 'hire', 'employe', 'instead', 'offer', 'quadrupl', 'hour', 'employe', 'limit', 'hour', 'maximum', 'week', 'school', 'week', 'probabl', 'interested_in', 'school', 'side', 'student', 'integr', 'commun', 'understand', 'goal', 'school', 'employ', 'might', 'truli', 'believ', 'educ', 'might', 'acknowledg', 'class', 'schedul', 'hard', 'limit', 'hour', 'week', 'offic', 'encourag', 'student', 'worker', 'look_at', 'syllabi', 'plan', 'accordingli', 'final', 'project', 'provid', 'level', 'mentorship', 'easili', 'lost', 'larg', 'colleg', 'like', 'mine', 'particularli', 'first', 'second', 'year', 'student', 'might', 'larg', 'lectur', 'hall', 'class', 'similarli', 'first', 'gener', 'student', 'supponetwork', 'often', 'recent', 'graduat', 'young', 'profession', 'provid', 'exampl', 'could', 'might', 'avoid', 'also', 'creat', 'commun', 'peer', 'people_who', 'take', 'class', ""do_n't"", 'take', 'class', 'yeah', 'first', 'year', 'super', 'hard', 'look', 'final', 'week', 'parti', 'spring', 'break', 'import', 'especi', 'student', 'away_from', 'home', 'academ', 'role', 'model', 'studi', 'show', 'first', 'semest', 'tap', 'grade', 'drop', 'follow', 'semest', 'overal', 'increas', 'score', 'compar', 'student', ""do_n't"", 'benefit', 'obtain', 'without', 'club', 'provid', 'the_sam', 'type', 'resili', 'commun', 'integr', 'field', 'studi', 'frat/soror', 'tutor', 'group', 'lead', 'next', 'govern', 'govern', 'want', 'good', 'student', 'good', 'employe', 'govern', 'monolith', 'mean', 'differ', 'thing', 'differ', 'part', 'govern', 'underli', 'tension', 'financial_aid', 'exploit', 'social', 'product', 'educ', 'labor', 'standard', 'loan', 'tangent', 'come', 'mind', 'loan', 'need', 'maintain', 'class', 'rate', 'colleg', 'long', 'hand', 'cost', 'school', 'rais', 'meet', 'avail', 'money', 'suppli', 'lender', 'money', 'churn', 'the_sam', 'maintain', 'grade', 'pace', ""it_'"", 'also', 'teach', 'profession', 'miss', 'shift', 'often', 'minimum', 'wage', 'school', 'exploit', 'labor', 'exploit', 'tension', 'also', 'fact', 'socioeconom', 'defin', 'access', 'privileg', 'need', 'accident', 'creat', 'reproduc', 'underclass', 'gener', 'wealth', 'provid', 'resum', 'experi', 'fund', 'chronic', 'serv', 'popul', 'think', 'gotten', 'topic', 'purpos', 'feder', 'work', 'studi', 'integr', 'reproduct', 'provid', 'grant', 'fund', 'string', 'student', 'commun', 'support', 'school', 'get', 'effect', 'wage', 'workforc', 'govern', 'provid', 'addit', 'incent', 'keep', 'grade', 'pace', 'leav', 'colleg', 'join', 'main', 'labor', 'market']","[(2, 1), (5, 3), (7, 2), (10, 1), (11, 4), (19, 2), (31, 6), (33, 8), (36, 1), (37, 2), (49, 1), (51, 1), (56, 1), (57, 3), (63, 1), (68, 2), (69, 1), (75, 2), (78, 2), (81, 3), (82, 1), (84, 2), (87, 1), (88, 1), (96, 1), (103, 5), (120, 1), (132, 1), (134, 4), (135, 1), (139, 1), (143, 1), (148, 1), (154, 2), (159, 2), (166, 3), (170, 1), (179, 2), (181, 1), (182, 1), (186, 1), (188, 1), (191, 1), (192, 2), (195, 1), (196, 1), (197, 1), (202, 1), (216, 1), (229, 2), (240, 2), (248, 1), (256, 1), (258, 1), (271, 2), (279, 1), (286, 6), (288, 1), (292, 1), (304, 1), (306, 1), (317, 4), (318, 2), (321, 1), (329, 4), (339, 1), (340, 1), (343, 2), (346, 1), (354, 1), (361, 1), (371, 1), (385, 2), (386, 1), (394, 1), (399, 1), (435, 1), (444, 1), (448, 1), (450, 3), (462, 1), (466, 3), (469, 1), (481, 2), (491, 1), (501, 2), (523, 1), (534, 1), (547, 1), (548, 1), (556, 1), (566, 1), (568, 1), (573, 1), (577, 1), (588, 1), (597, 1), (622, 2), (627, 1), (639, 1), (652, 1), (653, 2), (654, 1), (660, 1), (670, 1), (681, 1), (696, 1), (699, 1), (707, 1), (713, 1), (721, 1), (732, 2), (736, 1), (738, 1), (740, 1), (744, 1), (754, 1), (755, 1), (757, 1), (767, 2), (768, 1), (773, 1), (774, 1), (794, 1), (831, 1), (838, 1), (843, 1), (861, 1), (864, 1), (877, 1), (880, 1), (885, 1), (905, 1), (917, 1), (920, 2), (921, 2), (928, 1), (935, 1), (984, 5), (998, 1)]",[0.        0.        0.0046729 ... 0.        0.        0.       ]
2904,t3_1cay0er,1713855100.0,"hello,

recently i've been struggling with the thought that i should i go back to school and get an engineering degree. i'm currently in my mid twenties, hold two degrees (economics and political science), am a veteran and have a pretty solid career trajectory in my field. the issue is none of this really fits into engineering and i don't really know if i want to actually work as an engineer. i cannot justify going back to school because of this, but i also cannot shake the feeling that i am somehow missing out by not having studied engineering. i've always wanted to, but the school i attended didn't offer it and i've always thought i wasn't smart enough to try. having now shaken that, my next concern is that i am too old and it does not make any sense to do so, however not doing so would seem like i am selling myself short. if i were to do this i would attempt aerospace engineering. the best i could describe this feeling is that it is a bucket list sort of thing. i want to check this box and that really is my only solid justification for it, good or bad. 

i guess what this boils down to is that i am wondering if anybody has gone back to get a third degree and if so how did that go? currently i should really be looking at a masters in my field, but it feels like the wrong path. that being said, pursuing engineering this late in the game could cripple my career trajectory, which i've only really had on track since leaving the military. 

thank you for your time.

some of - if not most of - the effect you're noting is that college excludes the bottom. completing a college degree requires a certain minimum level of intelligence and drive - as well as time/money. so when you compare the group of people who have completed a college degree against those who have not, a major component of what you're comparing is the exclusion of a disadvantaged group.

it's akin to observing that those on the second floor of a building are faster runners than those on the first floor. does standing on a different floor make you run better? no. but the stairs exclude all those who can't run at all from the average.

you can get this degree if you want it for much, much cheaper for where if you have issues after graduation, you will not be saddled with debt that can only be discharged via death or extreme disability. it would suck to have 100k hitting you when if you get out, the only thing you can get is a restaurant assistant manager gig at a lower tier establishment maybe making half that and not being able to do much marketing.",2024-04-23 04:16:45,"['would', 'unless', 'famili', 'happen', 'know', 'people_who', 'major', 'busi', 'sure', 'posit', 'pay', '100k+', 'degre', 'formal', 'peopl', 'fan', 'overpr', 'colleg', 'offic', 'decor', 'overpr', 'colleg', 'shwag', 'too_much', 'market', 'degre', 'also', 'realiz', 'market', 'broad', 'field', 'mani', 'market', ""do_n't"", 'special', 'peopl', 'never', 'took', 'market', 'class', 'might', 'degre', 'want', 'much', 'much', 'cheaper', 'issu', 'graduat', 'saddl', 'debt', 'discharg', 'death', 'extrem', 'disabl', 'would', 'suck', '100k', 'hit', 'thing', 'restaur', 'assist', 'manag', 'lower', 'tier', 'establish', 'mayb', 'make', 'half', 'able_to', 'much', 'market']","[(5, 2), (36, 1), (57, 1), (69, 1), (84, 1), (86, 1), (101, 1), (103, 1), (118, 1), (136, 2), (142, 1), (144, 1), (181, 1), (186, 1), (241, 1), (252, 1), (263, 3), (308, 1), (315, 1), (329, 1), (336, 1), (354, 1), (360, 1), (363, 1), (373, 1), (388, 2), (427, 1), (446, 3), (484, 1), (491, 1), (496, 1), (510, 1), (532, 1), (554, 1), (579, 1), (617, 1), (624, 1), (702, 1), (753, 1), (843, 5), (919, 1), (928, 1), (973, 1), (1010, 1)]",[0.         0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.01818182]

2944,t3_1cazxb1,1713863102.0,"recently, i have faced racism and discrimination in my direction. i moved from russia to the usa in 2021. although i graduated from college there with a 4.0 gpa, i had to graduate from high school in america to be able to go to university. but, my grades at the university refuse to be accepted, so i have to take a lot of low-level classes in order not to waste time and money. at the moment, i have to take 9 lessons in total, both at the university and at the community college. the situation is just happening at glendale community college, where i have to take the lowest drawing class. 

from the very beginning, my teacher seemed strange to me because of his statements and ""creativity"", because, to be honest, my teacher has a very low level of qualification and drawing. but i turned a blind eye to it, because i only need this class for evaluation. i handed over all the work on time and followed the instructions clearly, but they started to greatly underestimate my grades. just like that, but at the same time trying to find some minor mistakes that were not even written in the task, and some were simply sucked out of the finger. although, comparing the students' work, mine turn out to be of a higher level, just because i have an education already and extensive work and drawing experience, i'm not trying to offend anyone. but for some reason, almost all students get excellent grades, when my score is now 73%. 

to be honest, i didn't understand what was going on at all, i tried to talk to her, but she just stopped answering me. i was trying to find why she is doing that until i found out a couple of very interesting interviews that were taken from my teacher as an ""artist"". and the truth was revealed to me. she just fiercely hates white people, which is not even hidden in her statements. all of her work is based on hatred of whites and the rise of the black race. as a person who has not lived all his life in america, i absolutely cannot understand why she was angry at me, lol, i don't even have anything to do with all this movement. perhaps my work offended her in some way, because one of my creative assignments came out on a political topic - and she underestimated it the most, but is this a reason for such an attitude towards students? 

i also tried to check the professor on rate my professor, but it turned out that almost all the negative reviews about her were deleted, but there was a moment that she attacked her students on social networks, as well as that she always gives a lot of extra credit to works, but for some reason she categorically refuses to give them to me. due to the fact that these courses are held online, it is difficult to understand what kind of experience other students have. 

there is a lot to talk about this, but i will move on to the main issue of my post. what should be done in such situations? should i try to keep trying to talk to the teacher who stopped answering my questions, or contact the college administration right away? i really care about my grades tho and i've done too much for some low-level teacher to ruin my entire academic record.",2024-04-23 05:05:02,"['recent', 'face', 'racism', 'discrimin', 'direct', 'move', 'russia', '2021.', 'although', 'graduat', 'colleg', 'graduat', 'high_school', 'america', 'be_abl', 'univers', 'grade', 'univers', 'refus', 'accept', 'take', 'a_lot', 'low-level', 'class', 'order', 'wast', 'time', 'money', 'moment', 'take', 'lesson', 'total', 'univers', 'community_colleg', 'situat', 'happen', 'glendal', 'community_colleg', 'take', 'lowest', 'draw', 'class', 'begin', 'teacher', 'seem', 'strang', 'statement', 'creativ', 'honest', 'teacher', 'level', 'qualif', 'draw', 'turn', 'blind', 'need', 'class', 'evalu', 'hand', 'work', 'time', 'follow', 'instruct', 'clearli', 'start', 'greatli', 'underestim', 'grade', 'like', 'the_sam', 'time', 'tri', 'find', 'minor', 'mistak', 'even', 'written', 'task', 'simpli', 'suck', 'finger', 'although', 'compar', 'student', 'work', 'mine', 'turn', 'higher', 'level', 'educ', 'alreadi', 'extens', 'work', 'draw', 'experi', 'tri', 'offend', 'anyon', 'reason', 'almost', 'student', 'excel', 'grade', 'score', 'honest', ""did_n't"", 'understand', 'go', 'tri', 'talk', 'stop', 'answer', 'tri', 'find', 'found', 'coupl', 'interest', 'interview', 'taken', 'teacher', 'artist', 'truth', 'reveal', 'fierc', 'hate', 'white', 'peopl', 'even', 'hidden', 'statement', 'work', 'based_on', 'hatr', 'white', 'rise', 'black', 'race', 'person', 'live', 'life', 'america', 'absolut', 'understand', 'angri', ""do_n't"", 'even', 'anyth', 'movement', 'perhap', 'work', 'offend', 'creativ', 'assign', 'came', 'polit', 'topic', 'underestim', 'reason', 'attitud', 'toward', 'student', 'also', 'tri', 'check', 'professor', 'rate', 'professor', 'turn', 'almost', 'neg', 'review', 'delet', 'moment', 'attack', 'student', 'social', 'network', 'as_wel', 'alway', 'give', 'a_lot', 'extra', 'credit', 'work', 'reason', 'categor', 'refus', 'give', 'fact', 'cours', 'held', 'onlin', 'difficult', 'understand', 'kind_of', 'experi', 'student', 'a_lot', 'talk', 'move', 'main', 'issu', 'post', 'done', 'situat', 'keep', 'tri', 'talk', 'teacher', 'stop', 'answer', 'question', 'contact', 'colleg', 'administr', 'right', 'away', 'realli', 'care', 'grade', 'done', 'too_much', 'low-level', 'teacher', 'ruin', 'entir', 'academ', 'record']","[(0, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (19, 1), (25, 1), (26, 1), (27, 1), (33, 5), (35, 3), (48, 1), (52, 2), (54, 3), (55, 6), (57, 1), (68, 1), (76, 1), (78, 3), (82, 1), (83, 2), (84, 1), (94, 3), (99, 1), (103, 3), (105, 1), (107, 3), (110, 2), (111, 1), (113, 1), (132, 3), (135, 6), (148, 1), (171, 1), (172, 1), (175, 1), (182, 1), (189, 2), (192, 1), (196, 1), (202, 1), (204, 2), (209, 3), (221, 1), (227, 1), (232, 1), (236, 1), (237, 1), (248, 1), (254, 1), (256, 1), (260, 1), (266, 1), (268, 1), (271, 1), (272, 1), (275, 1), (282, 1), (290, 1), (291, 1), (298, 2), (299, 1), (303, 1), (308, 1), (311, 2), (313, 2), (315, 1), (316, 1), (339, 1), (345, 1), (354, 2), (359, 1), (360, 1), (370, 1), (371, 1), (375, 1), (378, 1), (384, 1), (388, 1), (411, 1), (413, 3), (448, 2), (449, 1), (462, 1), (463, 2), (464, 1), (466, 4), (467, 1), (469, 1), (477, 1), (502, 2), (509, 1), (522, 1), (536, 1), (558, 2), (568, 1), (583, 1), (590, 5), (619, 1), (627, 1), (643, 1), (647, 1), (650, 1), (670, 1), (675, 1), (696, 2), (701, 1), (702, 1), (706, 2), (722, 2), (749, 1), (768, 1), (772, 1), (779, 2), (830, 1), (864, 1), (885, 1), (910, 1), (918, 1), (972, 1), (1004, 1), (1007, 1), (1009, 2)]",[0.01657459 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.01104972 0.        ]

im currently split between two choices. my dream is to go to uf under the animal sciences major and become a veterinarian. unfortunately i didn't get accepted for the fall of 2024 however, i was accepted to uf online and santa fe honors and just need some advice on what i should do next.

i want to know if one is better than the other in regards of transferring. i will be moving to gainesville this summer so i am not really considering going anywhere else.

ive read that going to a cc is a lot better because universities have to accept students from them but does that make transferring from uf online harder? or is it just less conventional. i currently have 100% bright futures (full tuition at any fl public school) so i wouldn't have to pay for the ""optional fee package"" which allows me to use all of the uf amenities which is very nice because i can do anything another student can do just without having in person classes but at the end of the day my main concern is transferring that is what i want to do. i want the best chance to be an in person student at uf and tbh i am a little worried taking online classes because i didn't have a good experience during covid. my counselor is telling me to just go to uf online and that ill have a lot better chances but what im reading on most posts is the opposite so i would just like someone to clear the air.

any advice or information about sf honors and uf online would be very helpful. thank you

\- for example, would i be able to get a job at uf as an online student, and have access to the same opportunities. santa fe honors has already sent me a lot of information about internships and volunteering opportunities which would be great for my goal of being a vet.

my parent's overprotectiveness has reached a whole new level, with constant worries and fears about what might happen to me once i'm away from home. it's like they can't shake the idea that something terrible will happen if they're not there to watch over me every second of the day.

i understand that their concerns come from a place of love and wanting what's best for me, but it's starting to feel suffocating. i want to spread my wings and experience life on my own terms, but their anxieties are holding me back.

i've tried talking to them about my desire for independence and the importance of pursuing my education, but it's like talking to a brick wall. they just can't seem to let go of their fears, and it's putting a strain on our relationship.

has anyone else dealt with overprotective parents who are afraid to let their children go to college? how did you navigate the situation and establish boundaries while still maintaining a positive relationship with your parent?

1) the academic and career benefits of you going to college. you could even set up a meeting with the chair of the department you’re going to and/or your college might have a department for first generation students. 

at my college, you could start shadowing research as a freshman and i also did a paid research program at my college between my freshman and sophomore year. then, i was able to do a work study program where i did work skills in my major while also getting breaks for finals, not having to worry about work scheduling me during a time i had class, etc. and then i did another year of research as a senior with a professor i knew well. this all led to me getting an internship at a company and graduating with a full time job offer making $$$ and this wouldn’t have happened if i didn’t go to a 4 year school. 

2) have them take a tour of campus and even meet with the director of campus safety. maybe you could arrange to text or call them at a specific time every day so they know you’re okay. most colleges now have blue light systems around campus,you can request a police escort if you’re walking home late at night, and profs will submit a wellness check report if you’re missing a couple classes. 

at the end of the day though, you’re not responsible for their anxiety and you may need to temporarily strain the relationship to do what’s best for your life",2024-04-23 07:17:49,"['would', 'focus_on', 'thing', 'academ', 'career', 'benefit', 'go', 'colleg', 'could', 'even', 'meet', 'chair', 'depart', '’_re', 'go', 'and/or', 'colleg', 'might', 'depart', 'first', 'gener', 'student', 'colleg', 'could', 'stashadow', 'research', 'freshman', 'also', 'paid', 'research', 'program', 'colleg', 'freshman', 'sophomor', 'year', 'able_to', 'work', 'studi', 'program', 'work', 'skill', 'major', 'also', 'get', 'break', 'final', 'worry_about', 'work', 'schedul', 'time', 'class', 'anoth', 'year', 'research', 'senior', 'professor', 'knew', 'well', 'get', 'internship', 'compani', 'graduat', 'full_tim', 'offer', 'make', 'wouldn_’', 'happen', 'didn_’', 'year', 'school', 'take', 'tour', 'campu', 'even', 'meet', 'director', 'campu', 'safeti', 'mayb', 'could', 'arrang', 'text', 'call', 'specif', 'time', 'everi', 'know', '’_re', 'okay', 'colleg', 'blue', 'light', 'system', 'around', 'campu', 'request', 'polic', 'escoif', '’_re', 'walk', 'home', 'late', 'night', 'prof', 'submit', 'well', 'check', 'repoif', '’_re', 'miss', 'coupl', 'class', 'though', '’_re', 'respons', 'anxieti', 'need', 'temporarili', 'strain', 'relationship', 'best', 'life']","[(5, 5), (11, 1), (31, 1), (33, 1), (34, 1), (35, 2), (37, 3), (42, 1), (44, 2), (51, 1), (57, 2), (62, 2), (66, 1), (68, 1), (78, 1), (82, 1), (85, 1), (87, 2), (103, 2), (107, 2), (113, 2), (129, 1), (135, 3), (136, 1), (139, 3), (144, 1), (153, 1), (154, 2), (166, 1), (172, 1), (186, 1), (206, 1), (218, 1), (232, 1), (247, 3), (252, 1), (257, 1), (287, 5), (295, 1), (305, 1), (314, 1), (321, 1), (329, 1), (331, 1), (340, 1), (353, 1), (354, 1), (360, 1), (361, 1), (365, 2), (373, 1), (385, 1), (387, 1), (437, 1), (455, 1), (459, 1), (471, 3), (481, 1), (483, 1), (485, 1), (492, 1), (496, 1), (510, 1), (517, 2), (522, 1), (556, 1), (558, 1), (574, 1), (611, 1), (658, 1), (726, 1), (736, 1), (769, 1), (782, 1), (799, 1), (802, 1), (813, 1), (863, 1), (941, 1), (993, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

i’m not encouraging you to take on more debt, but i would encourage you to look into programs funded by the government. hopefully something will offer more pay than you are currently finding. a number of my peers had a ton of funding via government for additional education that i wish i had known about. also, get networking. networking is so so important and it also lets you know what other opportunities are out there to take advantage of. it may even secure new jobs for you.

i also want to iterate that 30 is not old. it is so so young. my father went to med school at 30 and was very very successful. my life would have not been the same if my father decided not to go to med school at that age. in one of my programs, i also met various professionals in their 30’s and 40’s switching professions for something they were more inclined too. some were very impressive jobs too (engineers, accountants etc). so if you really decide you want to make that change, it is not too late. it’s not about getting “ahead”, whatever that means in our current society, it’s about making a life that is happy for you. you may have to make some sacrifices though. pay off as much debt as you possibly can every month. cut back on non-necessities. the more you can pay, the more you will get ahead. don’t get stuck in only paying the minimum rates. that is how they keep you in the trap.",2024-04-23 08:39:19,"['first', 'sorri', 'happen', 'second', 'don_’', 'think', 'degre', 'actual', 'happen', 'a_lot', 'peopl', 'believ', 'time', 'special', 'job', 'hard', 'secur', 'peopl', 'know', 'inner', 'connect', 'guid', 'posit', 'especi', 'time', 'good', 'also', 'kind_of', 'irk', 'thing', 'aren_’', 'mention', 'know', 'happen', 'peopl', 'like', 'their_own', 'achiev', 'unfortun', 'network', 'connect', 'heck', 'longer', 'educ', '’_ve', 'known', 'busi', 'graduat', 'pass', 'busi', 'posit', 'graduat', 'complet', 'unrel', 'degre', 'simpli', 'rel', 'work', 'compani', 'pull', 'string', 'encourag', 'take', 'debt', 'would', 'encourag', 'look', 'program', 'fund', 'govern', 'hope', 'someth', 'offer', 'current', 'find', 'number', 'peer', 'fund', 'govern', 'addit', 'educ', 'wish', 'known', 'also', 'network', 'network', 'import', 'also', 'let', 'know_what', 'opportun', 'take', 'advantag', 'even', 'secur', 'job', 'also', 'want', 'iter', 'young', 'father', 'went', 'school', 'success', 'life', 'would', 'the_sam', 'father', 'decid', 'school', 'program', 'also', 'variou', 'profession', 'switch', 'profess', 'someth', 'inclin', 'impress', 'job', 'engin', 'account', 'realli', 'decid', 'want', 'make', 'chang', 'too_lat', 'get', 'ahead', 'whatev', 'mean', 'current', 'societi', 'make', 'life', 'happi', 'make', 'sacrific', 'though', 'much', 'debt', 'possibl', 'everi', 'month', 'back', 'non-necess', 'ahead', 'don_’', 'stuck', 'pay', 'minimum', 'rate', 'keep', 'trap']","[(0, 1), (1, 1), (11, 1), (14, 1), (31, 2), (35, 2), (36, 2), (38, 1), (39, 1), (43, 2), (48, 1), (56, 1), (57, 5), (59, 1), (78, 2), (81, 2), (101, 2), (107, 1), (110, 1), (117, 1), (129, 1), (135, 1), (136, 2), (138, 1), (143, 1), (144, 3), (147, 1), (149, 2), (154, 1), (177, 1), (179, 1), (181, 1), (182, 1), (186, 1), (187, 1), (192, 2), (196, 1), (211, 1), (229, 1), (252, 2), (263, 1), (271, 1), (283, 1), (293, 1), (299, 1), (310, 2), (314, 1), (325, 1), (333, 1), (337, 2), (343, 1), (348, 1), (354, 2), (360, 3), (363, 2), (365, 2), (371, 1), (381, 1), (386, 1), (388, 3), (395, 1), (399, 1), (405, 1), (410, 1), (426, 1), (438, 2), (444, 1), (446, 2), (459, 1), (462, 1), (473, 2), (475, 1), (501, 1), (522, 2), (538, 2), (551, 1), (556, 1), (588, 1), (620, 1), (624, 1), (642, 1), (653, 1), (657, 1), (678, 1), (701, 3), (765, 1), (808, 1), (816, 1), (831, 1), (844, 1), (858, 1), (871, 1), (880, 1), (884, 1), (917, 1), (935, 2), (945, 3), (947, 2), (973, 2), (984, 2), (988, 1)]",[0.00714286 0.00714286 0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

all of this is really just saying take steps anyway. personally, this has been my remedy. when i asked or tried to talk things out, i got so much push back, so i ultimately stopped asking, i started doing. this is a slippery slope though. parents do really know better in many situations, but if you feel smothered and are ready to start feeling like a young adult, which is what college will start making you feel, it’s best to start thinking and doing for yourself. if you need help, they will always love helping you (or perhaps, love thinking that they’re helping you), so you can ask when you need it, but try doing some things by yourself first. i think it’s important to start small. start doing things in regular life that mimic independence, like a part time job, going out with friends more often, maybe even buying some small stuff for your dorm. little things by yourself! by the time you get to a dorm or on campus, your feelings about their feelings won’t matter as much because you’ll already be there because you have already made a decision about your life. :) cheers 🥂💫",2024-04-23 09:26:47,"['truth', 'someth', 'still', 'navig', 'sophomor', 'colleg', 'thing', 'kind_of', 'take', 'action', 'overprotect', 'parent', 'easi', 'fall', 'verbal', 'battl', 'independ', 'like', 'topic', 'moment', 'stato', 'take', 'action', 'wit', 'aftermath', 'deal', 'idea', '’_re', 'begin', 'thing', 'without', 'discuss', 'spread', 'wing', 'first', 'happen', 'best', 'paabout', 'protect', 'parent', 'mess', 'kind_of', 'like', 'reason', 'someth', 'find', 'peac', 'even_though', 'goal', 'gain', 'independ', 'isn_’', 'mess', 'paof', 'process', 'realli', 'say', 'take', 'step', 'anyway', 'person', 'has_been', 'remedi', 'ask', 'tri', 'talk', 'thing', 'so_much', 'push', 'back', 'ultim', 'stop', 'ask', 'start', 'slipperi', 'slope', 'though', 'parent', 'realli', 'know', 'better', 'mani', 'situat', 'feel', 'smother', 'readi', 'stafeel', 'like', 'young', 'adult', 'colleg', 'stamak', 'feel', 'best', 'stathink', 'need', 'help', 'alway', 'love', 'help', 'perhap', 'love', 'think', '’_re', 'help', 'need', 'thing', 'first', 'think', 'import', 'stasmal', 'stado', 'thing', 'regular', 'life', 'mimic', 'independ', 'like', 'patim', 'go', 'friend', 'often', 'mayb', 'even', 'buy', 'small', 'stuff', 'dorm', 'littl', 'thing', 'time', 'dorm', 'on_campu', 'feel', 'feel', 'won_’', 'matter', 'much', '’_ll', 'alreadi', 'alreadi', 'made', 'decis', 'life', 'cheer']","[(5, 2), (11, 2), (24, 3), (35, 1), (48, 2), (52, 1), (54, 1), (55, 1), (58, 2), (59, 1), (61, 1), (65, 1), (67, 1), (68, 2), (74, 1), (76, 1), (78, 3), (86, 1), (107, 1), (108, 4), (110, 1), (112, 1), (113, 1), (127, 1), (129, 1), (149, 2), (156, 1), (163, 1), (182, 2), (186, 6), (188, 1), (194, 3), (196, 4), (209, 1), (229, 2), (252, 1), (253, 1), (255, 1), (259, 1), (262, 3), (263, 1), (282, 1), (285, 1), (287, 2), (289, 1), (290, 1), (316, 2), (330, 1), (335, 2), (356, 1), (357, 1), (360, 1), (375, 1), (377, 1), (379, 1), (380, 1), (386, 1), (421, 1), (428, 1), (437, 2), (439, 2), (495, 1), (502, 1), (506, 1), (510, 1), (513, 1), (522, 2), (523, 2), (567, 1), (580, 2), (609, 1), (615, 1), (722, 1), (723, 1), (732, 1), (810, 1), (826, 1), (831, 1), (832, 1), (877, 1), (885, 1), (941, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

the one rule that i stick to is to be open and honest about everything. seriously. everything. if it seems small and insignificant, talk about it. discuss overnight guests, sleeping habits, noise levels, chores, cleanliness, food, boundaries, pet peeves, everything. i know this might seem weird or awkward to do, but this will help sooooo much, i promise. get to know them as people, it will make everything easier. 

psychologically speaking, you think differently than they do, so it’s going to be an adjustment when you interact with them on a daily basis in your shared home. from experience, they usually don’t notice things that seem obvious, especially things that can cause problems or that bother other people. just talk to them, you will get used to them, and them to you. 

hopefully you get to a place where you all become really good friends, it’s the best! i have seen many people advise people in your situation not to date your roommates; i am someone who is dating one of my roommates so i obviously have opinions about this. i’m not encouraging you, nor am i against it. if you decide to date one of them, you need to be completely sure that you want to date this person long term. you would be taking a huge risk, and this will cause issues in your home. be very careful, not only with the guy you might date, but the others as well. again, communication is important here.

if you want my advice, change your major. if you only do comp sci for the money and/or cannot see yourself coding 8 hours a day for the rest of your life, you won't be able to pass the harder classes you take on later. and even if you do, you'll be miserable all the while. don't put yourself through that. do something you're passionate about (it could even be something you're midly interested in) as that will be better than destroying your mental health and spending four years of your life in a horrid state. 

you can make money and a good career no matter what major. you can also shift your career path later in life. the real key is networking, that's how you'll get a good job regardless of your major.

3112,t3_1cb9f04,1713890749.0,"hi everyone,

i'm currently facing a dilemma about switching colleges and could use some advice. i've been studying management and finance as double majors, but i'm considering a switch to a stem field—specifically psychology and biology, which really interest me but i dont want to waste these 2 year in the trash

the college i want to switch to accept 12 out of my 47 credits of my business degree, essentially meaning i'd be starting over as a freshman. my counselor advised me to stay and complete my double majors, but the next term will be fully online, which diminishes my college experience and i do nerver want to do online classes again.

i have four years of fafsa eligibility remaining, and i'm two years away from completing my current business degree.

i plan to switch  and start the new degree in stem. to finance the remaining two years of my business degree, i would rely on external scholarships or take out a loan. additionally, i'm considering enlisting in the military to pursue my m.s. and also plan to delay my graduation to preserve fafsa eligibility for the stem degree.

complicating matters, my parents do not support my decision to transfer and prefer that i stay home with them, they also want me to finish college fast, but i dont want to face loneliness or be miserable after college.

is it possible ? and what is ur guys opinion and advice ?

thanks in advance

edit: i take 6 buisness classes rn, and i find it easy.

going to trade school taught me alot, the instructors were incredible and focused on problem solving and thinking for yourself, as well as the greater theories that make cars and so many other machines work. they would intentionally lie to us sometimes to see if we agreed and then would correct us and challenge them on the fact that they were wrong

anyways, i worked as an auto tech for several years and decided i wanted more from my life

went back to learn graphic design and video. it was considerably harder and more stressful. i did get a job that im doing now and.. i dont really like it and its objectively not really a good gig

i dont really know if im going to be able to get a job in a creative field at the moment. so far, not so good. i graduated and the job market was scuffed and now ai is looking like a serious threat and idk. im not sure what i can do to get hired. i was hoping this job would help me get some portfolio pieces but, nah

i regret going to college sometimes honestly. i didnt really take any financial loss. my first time my parents covered it, and the second time i got grants scholarships and financing. because i was 26, i was considered independent from my parents income and i didnt make shit so i was considered poor enough to help, ironically because i am decently privelaged. 

if i had stuck with automotive i may be able to make a living right now

its hard to say, but i do regret it sometimes. if i had debt weighing over me because of this, i would probably regret it.

3124,t1_l0wx8b3,1713891514.0,"my observation about the many parents i've interacted with over the past 10 years:

in k-12, there is an expectation for parents to be heavily involved in their child's success, to the point where they are shamed (both socially and by the schools) for taking anything approximating a hands-off approach. for example, in many school districts parents are given access to the school's online learning management system and they're expected to monitor their student's progress on a weekly or daily basis. they are made to feel like bad parents (often this falls more on the mom) if they don't do this.

then the student gets to college. and now we not only don't give parents access, we shame them for being so involved. it's a complete 180 on social expectations. add to that the very difficult of emotions of watching your kid become more independent and encounter adult challenges for the first time, and some of them go full mama-bear/papa-bear mode.

another commenter noted that there's some class anxiety at work here, and that's been my observation as well. upper middle class parents at my school are much more likely to heavily involve themselves in their child's educational decisions. parents who didn't go to college or have lower incomes are less likely to feel the same social pressure to be so involved in the college years. middle class parents can go either way. (my campus has few ultra-wealthy students, so i don't know what the trends are for the 1%er parents.)

also, the helicopter parent debate is at least 25 years old (if not older). anecdotally, i don't think it's worse now. i think the particulars have shifted in response to technology, but the overall behaviors and social pressures are pretty much the same.",2024-04-23 12:58:34,"['observ', 'mani', 'parent', 'interact', 'past', 'year', 'k-12', 'expect', 'parent', 'heavili', 'involv', 'child', 'success', 'point', 'shame', 'social', 'school', 'take', 'anyth', 'approxim', 'hands-off', 'approach', 'exampl', 'mani', 'school', 'district', 'parent', 'given', 'access', 'school', 'onlin', 'learn', 'manag', 'system', ""they_'r"", 'expect', 'monitor', 'student', 'progress', 'weekli', 'daili', 'basi', 'made', 'feel_lik', 'parent', 'often', 'fall', ""do_n't"", 'student', 'get', 'colleg', ""do_n't"", 'give', 'parent', 'access', 'shame', 'involv', ""it_'"", 'complet', 'social', 'expect', 'difficult', 'emot', 'watch', 'becom', 'independ', 'encount', 'adult', 'challeng', 'first', 'time', 'full', 'mama-bear/papa-bear', 'mode', 'anoth', 'comment', 'note', 'class', 'anxieti', 'work', 'observ', 'as_wel', 'upper', 'middl', 'class', 'parent', 'school', 'much', 'like', 'heavili', 'involv', 'child', 'educ', 'decis', 'parent', ""did_n't"", 'colleg', 'lower', 'incom', 'less', 'like', 'feel', 'the_sam', 'social', 'pressur', 'involv', 'colleg', 'year', 'middl', 'class', 'parent', 'either', 'campu', 'ultra-wealthi', 'student', ""do_n't"", 'know_what', 'trend', 'parent', 'also', 'helicopt', 'parent', 'debat', 'at_least', 'year', 'older', 'anecdot', ""do_n't"", 'think', ""it_'"", 'wors', 'think', 'particular', 'shift', 'respons', 'technolog', 'overal', 'behavior', 'social', 'pressur', 'pretty_much', 'the_sam']","[(5, 3), (11, 1), (12, 1), (16, 1), (24, 10), (31, 4), (33, 3), (35, 1), (37, 3), (57, 1), (61, 1), (78, 1), (84, 4), (86, 2), (89, 1), (96, 2), (103, 3), (105, 1), (108, 1), (135, 1), (138, 1), (154, 1), (162, 1), (176, 3), (177, 1), (192, 1), (195, 2), (196, 2), (204, 1), (206, 1), (218, 1), (229, 2), (235, 1), (236, 1), (241, 1), (247, 1), (255, 1), (262, 1), (263, 1), (271, 2), (303, 1), (312, 4), (333, 1), (339, 4), (356, 1), (359, 1), (362, 1), (401, 1), (419, 1), (464, 1), (519, 1), (527, 2), (532, 1), (533, 1), (557, 1), (595, 1), (603, 1), (609, 1), (635, 2), (664, 1), (686, 1), (691, 1), (717, 1), (727, 1), (732, 1), (744, 1), (758, 1), (766, 1), (773, 1), (802, 1), (804, 2), (813, 1), (834, 1), (838, 1), (855, 1), (878, 1), (990, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

my only 2 days off will be devoted on campus going to my classes, and i’m also wanting to increase my classes to 9 credit hours at some point, if i can handle it in person.

my body can’t take manual labor. i’ve tried working at amazon, and with my joint conditions, it just takes too much out of me. what kind of jobs have people worked that were accommodating to a school schedule while making a good amount of money?

i took irrelevant courses this year, as well as one course in the spring of 2023, in order to boost my gpa and be considered for t20 schools and even ivies (i was told when applying to ivy leagues, courses don't matter, so i ran along with it). in my original degree as a business administration major, i am missing two courses (a science course and intro to microsoft). 

  
i am struggling with the idea of either graduating with an associate's in general studies instead of business admin, and taking the science course in the summer, or just transfer to the universities i got accepted to without an associate's degree.  

  
so far, i have luckily been accepted to a few schools (rutgers nb and newark, binghamton), so i might commit to one of those fast instead of focusing on a t20.

so i had no interest and no one telling me computers were a job. so i was at home a nerd with my apple and old commodore that was already obsolete. and i learned. gosh darn it if my hobby didn't make my first degree easy, not only did i know the topic i wanted to be there, was excited to go.

i (22m) graduated high school 4 years ago. when the world shut down, i got complacent with the day to day life of being lazy so i did not go to college right away. i regret it because i know if i didn’t let the distractions get to me i wouldn’t be writing this post and i'd be graduating college this year…

anyways. i am going to my city's community college this fall to pursue a degree in health care studies, which will then let me pursue becoming a x-ray tech or respiratory therapist.

i work a full time customer service job at a big health insurance company and they offer some great tuition assistance benefits. i hate the job as its destroying my personality but the pay is ""good"" for what i am doing and i have to stay to receive the benefits, naturally.  the problem is, the school path i am taking barely offers online learning so i have to decide what to do regarding my current employment. 

the department i work in does not offer part time hours; strictly 9-5 monday through friday. i wrote an email detailing my situation to my supervisor asking if there are other departments she could recommend me to apply to so i could stay with the company. she basically told me there's no guarantee that she'll be able to find me one and that if i could not find a solution then i should still pursue a higher education. she was saying that i can grow in this company but she knows its not for me.

so basically i'm screwed. 

  
i now have until september to save money and try to look for another job with tuition benefits and its just too much. i still have to take my placement tests, i cant talk to an advisor just yet because they aren't answering my calls or emails and i'm just so stressed out. as much as i do not like my job, i would love to still get the benefits. i applied for fafsa but i fear i make too much (i wont if i have to freaking quit) and i know the alternative is student loans and scholarships for having brown eyes,

policies may differ from college to college and state to state. but generally when a degree program is suspended, put on moratorium, or closed, the college has an obligation to make arrangements for the students enrolled in that program.

they might need to hire adjuncts, partner with another college, or provide independent study credits so that those students can finish their remaining credits and earn their degree. they may set a completion deadline for the teach-out plan, but you should be given the ability to finish your degree in a timely manner.

the college should be explaining their plan to students in that program, and if they aren't doing it pro-actively, you should start making some noise. teach-out policies are a federal requirement for accredited colleges, so this is something they need to take seriously.",2024-04-23 19:30:33,"['need', 'talk', 'admissions/advis', 'teach-out', 'plan', 'degre', 'polici', 'differ', 'colleg', 'colleg', 'state', 'state', 'gener', 'degre', 'program', 'suspend', 'moratorium', 'close', 'colleg', 'oblig', 'make', 'arrang', 'student', 'enrol', 'program', 'might', 'need', 'hire', 'adjunct', 'partner', 'anoth', 'colleg', 'provid', 'independ', 'studi', 'credit', 'student', 'finish', 'remain', 'credit', 'earn', 'degre', 'complet', 'deadlin', 'teach-out', 'plan', 'given', 'abil', 'finish', 'degre', 'time', 'manner', 'colleg', 'explain', 'plan', 'student', 'program', 'pro-act', 'stamak', 'nois', 'teach-out', 'polici', 'feder', 'requir', 'accredit', 'colleg', 'someth', 'need', 'take', 'serious']","[(5, 6), (12, 1), (28, 1), (33, 3), (35, 1), (49, 3), (53, 2), (54, 1), (60, 1), (68, 3), (78, 1), (138, 1), (144, 1), (149, 1), (166, 1), (206, 1), (261, 1), (262, 1), (268, 2), (286, 1), (318, 1), (329, 1), (365, 3), (423, 1), (434, 1), (446, 4), (447, 2), (453, 1), (481, 1), (651, 2), (739, 1), (754, 1), (827, 1), (963, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

1) you can act now and push. no matter what you do there always is the human element: you have to do interviews; you have to report to someone; you have to work with others for a common objective; everything in life involves working and interacting with other people. i would say as someone who is kind of an introvert but being in the teacher and counselor roles, you have to pretty much keep your own personal feelings within yourself and you have to go out there and pretty much expose yourself. jobs are all about being resilient and being adaptable to different situations which are strong markers for a successful candidate in any field. if you do have social anxiety issues, i do recommend may be starting slow like joining a club that you enjoy and getting to know members. you never know what opportunities you will have if you do not do it to begin with. 

this also goes when applying for jobs: you will never know the outcome unless you apply. if you get rejected, that is ok - you would be in the same position if you did not try!

it’s probably okay as long as the professor is not giving you an advantage in classes or playing favourites. also make sure you’re respecting each other’s boundaries, keeping a good distance between you two when necessary, and sharing household responsibilities. if all of these are followed then i think it’s probably okay.

ask yourself why you care so much about what age you graduate at. do you think others perceive you as less than them? if adults are judging you on that, it sounds like a them problem. are you trying to prove a certain point by graduating a certain age? if you truly value your education, age shouldn’t be a concern. learn what you love and/or want to do and feel proud that you’re doing something to follow your desired career path.",2024-04-23 23:47:40,"['dude', 'earli', 'graduat', 'year', 'bachelor', 'undergrad', 'good', 'year', 'school', 'financi', 'need', 'work', 'could', 'attend', 'patim', 'class', 'use', 'think', 'like', 'someon', 'gave', 'piec', 'advic', 'question', 'whether', 'continu', 'halfway', '’_re', 'go', 'the_sam', 'a_few', 'year', 'whether', 'continu', 'school', 'choos', 'educ', 'hope', 'better', 'field', 'want', 'continu', 'work', 'particular', 'situat', 'live', 'paycheck', 'paycheck', 'wonder', 'made', 'right', 'decis', 'care', 'so_much', 'graduat', 'think', 'other', 'perceiv', 'less', 'adult', 'judg', 'sounds_lik', 'problem', 'tri', 'prove', 'certain', 'point', 'graduat', 'certain', 'truli', 'valu', 'educ', 'concern', 'learn', 'love', 'and/or', 'want', 'feel', 'proud', '’_re', 'someth', 'follow', 'desir', 'career', 'path']","[(26, 1), (31, 2), (36, 2), (37, 3), (41, 1), (46, 1), (52, 1), (55, 1), (68, 1), (103, 1), (108, 1), (113, 1), (121, 1), (135, 2), (139, 1), (149, 1), (162, 1), (163, 1), (168, 1), (192, 2), (196, 1), (201, 1), (221, 1), (227, 1), (229, 2), (230, 1), (235, 1), (238, 1), (254, 1), (255, 1), (271, 1), (287, 2), (334, 1), (343, 1), (354, 3), (356, 1), (368, 2), (377, 1), (395, 1), (414, 2), (421, 1), (443, 1), (483, 1), (490, 1), (499, 3), (523, 1), (528, 1), (533, 1), (572, 1), (581, 1), (602, 1), (609, 1), (626, 1), (656, 1), (667, 1), (670, 1), (676, 1), (686, 1), (724, 1), (740, 1), (745, 1), (777, 1), (866, 1), (928, 1), (993, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

advise for you for as you continue on in your academic journey:
1. as others have stated, talk with your academic advisor on campus. if you aren’t close to them or have a difficult time reaching them (as that does happen sometimes) reach out to the advising department and see if you can be assigned a new advisor who might be easier to reach and meet with.
2. most students connect with at least one instructor as they get further into their degree plan (junior and senior year is when the major concentration classes really start after those general electives are all taken care of). instructors, especially in your major concentration, can be great people to talk about career goals and get ideas of what path you might need to take while still being in school. they may even know of some opportunities that you could get involved in that would help you later on as well.
3. reach out to the student services department or special programs like career services, personal and career counseling or even trio student support services if your school has one. these people are all specially trained and work with students on a daily basis helping them as they look at the workforce after college.

keep going and keep doing your best. remember your college experience is going to look different from everyone else around you and that is perfectly okay and very normal. don’t compare too much.",2024-04-24 00:10:45,"['sophomor', 'colleg', 'definit', 'too_lat', 'staget', 'involv', 'never', 'realli', 'reach', 'involv', 'join', 'mani', 'group', 'send', 'semest', 'junior', 'year', 'network', 'speak', 'learn', 'make', 'connect', 'differ', 'way', 'within', 'smaller', 'circl', 'struggl', 'graduat', 'consist', 'work', 'higher', 'posit', 'throughout', 'year', 'current', 'career', 'field', 'connect', 'email', 'first', 'help', 'reach', 'outsid', 'comfozon', 'talk', 'peopl', 'person', 'phone', 'alreadi', 'talk', 'email', 'give', 'common', 'ground', 'help', 'direct', 'convers', 'without', 'moment', 'advis', 'continu', 'academ', 'journey', 'other', 'state', 'talk', 'academ', 'advisor', 'on_campu', 'aren_’', 'close', 'difficult', 'time', 'reach', 'happen', 'sometim', 'reach', 'advis', 'depart', 'assign', 'advisor', 'might', 'easier', 'reach', 'meet', 'student', 'connect', 'at_least', 'instructor', 'degre', 'plan', 'junior', 'senior', 'year', 'major', 'concentr', 'class', 'realli', 'staafter', 'gener', 'elect', 'taken', 'care', 'instructor', 'especi', 'major', 'concentr', 'great', 'peopl', 'talk', 'career', 'goal', 'idea', 'path', 'might', 'need', 'take', 'still', 'school', 'even', 'know', 'opportun', 'could', 'involv', 'would', 'help', 'later', 'as_wel', 'reach', 'student', 'servic', 'depart', 'special', 'program', 'like', 'career', 'servic', 'person', 'career', 'counsel', 'even', 'trio', 'student', 'supposervic', 'school', 'peopl', 'special', 'train', 'work', 'student', 'daili', 'basi', 'help', 'look_at', 'workforc', 'colleg', 'keep', 'go', 'keep', 'best', 'rememb', 'colleg', 'experi', 'go', 'look', 'differ', 'everyon', 'els', 'around', 'perfectli', 'okay', 'normal', 'don_’', 'compar', 'too_much']","[(5, 3), (11, 1), (31, 2), (33, 4), (35, 1), (37, 3), (40, 2), (43, 1), (44, 2), (49, 1), (53, 1), (54, 4), (68, 1), (75, 1), (78, 1), (80, 1), (82, 2), (86, 1), (87, 1), (103, 1), (105, 1), (106, 2), (107, 2), (113, 2), (118, 1), (125, 1), (135, 2), (136, 1), (139, 1), (143, 1), (144, 1), (146, 1), (153, 1), (175, 1), (182, 2), (188, 1), (194, 4), (196, 1), (204, 1), (205, 2), (210, 1), (217, 1), (221, 1), (228, 1), (235, 1), (243, 2), (252, 1), (257, 1), (259, 1), (282, 2), (305, 1), (307, 1), (310, 1), (312, 3), (315, 1), (316, 1), (318, 2), (329, 2), (332, 1), (354, 1), (360, 1), (365, 1), (367, 1), (371, 2), (373, 2), (379, 1), (381, 1), (388, 3), (406, 1), (424, 1), (426, 1), (429, 1), (436, 1), (437, 1), (446, 1), (449, 1), (453, 1), (464, 1), (467, 1), (473, 3), (481, 1), (483, 4), (487, 1), (490, 1), (499, 1), (515, 1), (559, 6), (572, 1), (588, 1), (603, 1), (624, 2), (642, 1), (643, 1), (660, 1), (669, 1), (694, 1), (696, 1), (701, 1), (708, 1), (713, 1), (722, 1), (756, 2), (768, 1), (774, 1), (784, 1), (810, 1), (822, 1), (841, 2), (845, 2), (862, 1), (877, 1), (928, 1), (941, 1), (965, 1), (973, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

we have an evaluation form where we grade our project members after each presentation, and the percentage they each get determines their grade. ex. we get a 90 on the project but my overall effort score from my project mates is a 50, i would get a 45% grade. my project mates are reluctant to give cindy a bad grade due to pressure from some of her friends and worries that she will retaliate by giving everyone else bad grades.

i'm sick of all this, and recently realized i could probably make a good case for an academic integrity violation. we're in a few chatrooms and there is a little evidence of her using ai in her work which i may be able to pack into a personal report on her unethical behavior (not to mention the poor work quality), but i'm very worried that this will trickle down to everyone else who's actually doing work. we did, after all, submit multiple papers with barely-edited ai slop in them as a group. every member of the group except for me used chatgpt in some capacity, for ideas or for outlines of our papers, but nobody has done anything on the level of trash that cindy has, and i don't believe any of those things are academic integrity violations.

also, some ai detectors i tried to use online were dubious at best, reporting my own original work as ""potentially ai"", but reporting the paper as a whole as ""not ai"", and i technically cannot prove that cindy's section is ai in its current state except for how it's formatted very different from the rest of the paper with a kind of question-and-answer format that does not fit what we are trying to do.

does anyone have any ideas on what exactly i should do in this situation?

 plus i registered for day classes because i'm pretty sure my family would be unsafe with me going in the evening as a young lady. so i'm also not ready to start waking up early again i'm a night owl so mornings have always been hard for me. i would rather postpone and apply for september classes but i'm being told to just start classes.

hello! i went through a bunch of bs due to covid and personal reasons after i graduated hs, now i finally got my shit together and go to community college. i'm staying for the experience and to get straight a's. i plan to transfer either to a nyc college (where i'm from) or ucla or one of the uc's. i'll be 24 or 25 then, depending on how long i stay. i did always want that out of state college party experience. do you think it would be too late?",2024-04-24 05:11:40,"['plannin', 'colleg', 'year', 'hello', 'went', 'bunch', 'covid', 'person', 'reason', 'graduat', 'final', 'shit', 'togeth', 'community_colleg', 'stay', 'experi', 'straight', 'plan', 'transfer', 'either', 'colleg', 'ucla', ""'ll_be"", 'depending_on', 'long', 'stay', 'alway', 'want', 'state', 'colleg', 'parti', 'experi', 'think', 'would', 'too_lat']","[(5, 3), (32, 1), (36, 1), (37, 1), (49, 1), (53, 1), (83, 1), (92, 1), (126, 2), (136, 1), (187, 1), (209, 1), (229, 1), (282, 1), (290, 1), (297, 1), (341, 1), (354, 1), (385, 1), (391, 1), (426, 1), (548, 1), (573, 1), (582, 1), (630, 1), (663, 1), (691, 1), (696, 2), (817, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

after attending college (and withdrawing due to medical reasons) as a 17 year old and then going back when i was 26, i’m firmly of the belief that we should be promoting real-life experience from jobs and other opportunities before college more often. the difference between how i felt and how much i learned starting at 17 and how i felt going back at 26 were night and day. i’m still way ahead of a lot of my classmates in terms of integrity and work ethic because i’ve had to work adult jobs before coming to school and because my life revolves less around social experiences and more around what needs to get done.",2024-04-24 05:11:49,"['impost', 'syndrom', 'pretti', 'common', 'non-tradit', 'student', 'realli', 'care', 'class', 'peopl', 'want', 'learn', 'skill', 'fli', 'person', 'plane', 'side', 'state', 'twice', 'week', 'make', 'class', 'busi', 'degre', 'help', 'grandkid', 'busi', 'kid', 'their_own', 'attend', 'colleg', 'withdraw', 'medic', 'reason', 'year', 'go', 'back', 'firmli', 'belief', 'promot', 'real-lif', 'experi', 'job', 'opportun', 'colleg', 'often', 'differ', 'felt', 'much', 'learn', 'start', 'felt', 'go', 'back', 'night', 'still', 'ahead', 'a_lot', 'classmat', 'term', 'integr', 'work', 'ethic', '’_ve', 'work', 'adult', 'job', 'come', 'school', 'life', 'revolv', 'less', 'around', 'social', 'experi', 'around', 'need', 'done']","[(0, 1), (5, 2), (31, 1), (33, 1), (36, 1), (37, 1), (41, 1), (53, 1), (59, 2), (68, 1), (76, 1), (101, 2), (103, 2), (113, 2), (134, 1), (135, 2), (144, 1), (153, 2), (162, 1), (182, 1), (194, 1), (209, 1), (211, 1), (221, 1), (235, 2), (251, 1), (259, 1), (263, 1), (273, 1), (282, 1), (292, 1), (294, 1), (311, 1), (318, 1), (322, 1), (339, 1), (388, 1), (446, 1), (520, 2), (522, 1), (538, 1), (597, 1), (609, 1), (631, 1), (642, 1), (669, 1), (678, 1), (680, 1), (696, 2), (732, 1), (799, 1), (863, 1), (900, 1), (923, 1), (945, 2)]",[0.01515152 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

3466,t1_l10vi12,1713954215.0,"hi! aspiring nurse here too. i am applying to my community college's nursing program, adn (associates in nursing) program for fall 2025 and unfortunately i have to do it in the 4 year part time format because of my current work schedule and how much i work and the mandatory overtime for a good part of the year. i will be doing my bsn in an accelerated format once i am done with my adn and am an rn i will look for an employer that will pay for my bsn as long as i work there for x amount of time. my job covers tuition so i will be able to get my adn done with little to no cost to me. 

i already have an associates in criminal justice and i almost graduated with my associates in marketing this fall until i realized how this is not my passion and i can pursue nursing. i had no support system, sure i had a support system but only if i chose something *other* than nursing program. pretty fucked up. but now i just turned 30 and i'm on my own now, so i can follow my dreams not do what other people are pressuring me to do. my community college requires 3 pre requisites - elementary algebra i, essentials of chemistry (b minimum in both) and biology of the human organism (c minimum) and the hesi-a2 entrance exam with 3 subject areas, math + science + english. 70% on all main subject areas and 70% cumulative score is required. i plan on going above and beyond those ""minimums"". 75% or more of applicants who meet those minimums are accepted into the program. i am taking a prep course for the entrance exam to ensure i'm really ready. also studying months in advance for it.

i would say that the hard part, especially in california, can be getting into the program. i'm in upstate ny. some places require more pre requisites and/or a higher grade in all pre requisites than my program requires. what's on the entrance exam is different for each school. some do teas and some do hesi-a2. my community college's nursing program itself will require me to keep a c minimum in all my courses. the first 2 years i do ""basic"" courses, before entering the core nursing classes, but half i have done with my criminal justice degree and i will only have a&amp;p i and ii, microbiology and math for health sciences to do. so even though i am doing the 4 year part time evening classes program i will have a specialized schedule and plan to complete the program it may turn into a 3 year part time program rather than 4. i have to keep a c in a&amp;p i, a&amp;p ii, microbiology and math for health sciences before i can continue onto the core nursing classes. 3rd year, all classes in both semesters need to be c's before moving into the next year. 

yes nursing program will be a challenge, but it's not impossible. my ex's mom went back in her 40s to do it and she was very successful. i just turned 30 as i said above and i'm glad i have done other things degree wise to prep me for how to do school. do not let the difficulty level discourage you from doing it. you could do what i am doing, adn then once you're an rn find an employer who will pay for your bsn as long as you work there for x amount of time, or do bsn immediately after your adn especially if places in your area hire nurses with their bsn more than nurses with their adn. i may do it that way if i cannot find an employer who hires the way i want to, the whole pay for it if i work there for x amount of time. it can be done online 100% i believe because you don't need clinicals or anything for it since you're already an rn.",2024-04-24 06:23:35,"['aspir', 'nurs', 'appli', 'community_colleg', 'nurs', 'program', 'associ', 'nurs', 'program', 'fall', '2025', 'unfortun', 'year', 'patim', 'format', 'current', 'work', 'schedul', 'much', 'work', 'mandatori', 'overtim', 'good', 'paof', 'year', 'acceler', 'format', 'done', 'look', 'employ', 'as_long', 'work', 'amount_of', 'time', 'cover', 'tuition', 'be_abl', 'done', 'littl', 'cost', 'alreadi', 'associ', 'crimin', 'justic', 'almost', 'graduat', 'associ', 'market', 'fall', 'realiz', 'passion', 'pursu', 'nurs', 'supposystem', 'sure', 'supposystem', 'chose', 'someth', 'nurs', 'program', 'pretti', 'fuck', 'turn', 'follow', 'dream', 'peopl', 'pressur', 'community_colleg', 'requir', 'requisit', 'elementari', 'algebra', 'essenti', 'chemistri', 'minimum', 'biolog', 'human', 'organ', 'minimum', 'hesi-a2', 'entranc', 'exam', 'subject', 'area', 'math', 'scienc', 'english', 'main', 'subject', 'area', 'cumul', 'score', 'requir', 'plan', 'go', 'beyond', 'minimum', 'applic', 'meet', 'minimum', 'accept', 'program', 'take', 'prep', 'cours', 'entranc', 'exam', 'ensur', 'realli', 'readi', 'also', 'studi', 'month', 'advanc', 'would', 'hard', 'part', 'especi', 'california', 'get', 'program', 'upstat', 'place', 'requir', 'requisit', 'and/or', 'higher', 'grade', 'requisit', 'program', 'requir', 'entranc', 'exam', 'differ', 'school', 'tea', 'hesi-a2', 'community_colleg', 'nurs', 'program', 'requir', 'keep', 'minimum', 'cours', 'first', 'year', 'basic', 'cours', 'enter', 'core', 'nurs', 'class', 'half', 'done', 'crimin', 'justic', 'degre', '&_amp', 'microbiolog', 'math', 'health', 'scienc', 'even_though', 'year', 'patim', 'even', 'class', 'program', 'special', 'schedul', 'plan', 'complet', 'program', 'turn', 'year', 'patim', 'program', 'rather', 'keep', '&_amp', '&_amp', 'microbiolog', 'math', 'health', 'scienc', 'continu', 'onto', 'core', 'nurs', 'class', 'year', 'class', 'semest', 'need', 'move', 'next_year', 'nurs', 'program', 'challeng', ""it_'"", 'imposs', 'went', 'back', 'success', 'turn', 'said', 'glad', 'done', 'thing', 'degre', 'wise', 'prep', 'school', 'difficulti', 'level', 'discourag', 'could', ""you_'r"", 'find', 'employ', 'as_long', 'work', 'amount_of', 'time', 'immedi', 'especi', 'place', 'area', 'hire', 'nurs', 'more_than', 'nurs', 'find', 'employ', 'hire', 'want', 'whole', 'work', 'amount_of', 'time', 'done', 'onlin', '100_%', 'believ', ""do_n't"", 'need', 'clinic', 'anyth', 'sinc', ""you_'r"", 'alreadi']","[(11, 1), (28, 5), (31, 2), (35, 3), (36, 1), (37, 6), (43, 1), (45, 1), (49, 2), (51, 2), (57, 1), (59, 1), (61, 2), (68, 2), (73, 1), (75, 1), (78, 1), (83, 3), (84, 1), (87, 1), (91, 1), (99, 1), (103, 4), (107, 1), (110, 2), (113, 1), (115, 1), (117, 1), (135, 5), (136, 1), (138, 1), (139, 1), (143, 1), (148, 1), (149, 1), (154, 1), (157, 1), (160, 1), (163, 3), (166, 1), (171, 1), (182, 1), (186, 1), (187, 1), (189, 1), (195, 1), (199, 1), (203, 1), (225, 2), (236, 1), (242, 3), (245, 3), (246, 1), (253, 1), (263, 1), (264, 1), (279, 1), (289, 1), (294, 1), (298, 1), (303, 1), (311, 5), (316, 2), (318, 1), (333, 1), (336, 1), (343, 1), (354, 1), (365, 11), (371, 2), (378, 3), (388, 1), (392, 1), (402, 1), (413, 3), (431, 1), (442, 3), (444, 1), (446, 2), (448, 1), (466, 1), (467, 1), (472, 2), (488, 2), (499, 1), (501, 1), (513, 1), (527, 1), (546, 1), (564, 2), (569, 1), (587, 2), (588, 2), (601, 1), (617, 1), (624, 1), (648, 3), (670, 1), (703, 1), (709, 2), (723, 1), (727, 1), (734, 3), (747, 1), (753, 1), (754, 2), (760, 1), (765, 1), (790, 11), (811, 1), (812, 1), (820, 1), (843, 1), (847, 1), (848, 1), (851, 1), (852, 1), (853, 1), (854, 3), (861, 1), (864, 1), (865, 1), (880, 5), (899, 3), (906, 1), (920, 3), (940, 1), (975, 1), (993, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

if it was a required course and you didn't transfer credit for it in somehow, like via an ap exam or placement test score, or you took it as concurrent enrollment so it really was a college class, then yeah, you still have to take it. 

&gt;saying it’s impossible to transfer to a certain major/school (it was not)

it's not 'impossible,' and they shouldn't have said that, but unless you are transferring in ""guaranteed transfer"" stuff, which is mostly just gen eds, you almost always get hosed on credits, what previous classes you took still ""count"" towards your major, etc. at the very least, you're basically at the mercy of the new school/department on a lot of that. going back to your ""i already took this in hs!"" complaint, they could very well refuse to accept a college course you took because they want all of their students to take ""their"" version of it.

3540,t1_l121uy6,1713972244.0,"hi! i started my undergrad at 31 and finished at 35. i started my masters at 40 and am finishing up now at 43 (going part time because i work full time.) i'm also not yet married and don't have kids - which was somewhat by choice. 

don't feel old or stupid. ""should"" is an awful word - take it out of your vocabulary when talking about your life because it's referring to that society or your family or whoever else decided is the right path in life. but there is no right path - that is different for everyone. 

also - i would get discouraging comments about how old i'll be when i graduate and whatnot - but here's the thing. the years are going to pass regardless. initially i was going to do my undergrad part time, and people were like 'you'll be 40 by the time you finish, why bother?' here's why: the years will pass regardless. i was going to get to 40 either way, so i'd rather get there with a degree. (which i did!) you're going to graduate before you're even 30 - which leaves plenty of time for career and marriage and babies. i know it sucks being older than everyone but so what? honestly, most classmates admired me for doing it regardless of my age - and i was often closer in age to my teachers than my classmates!! (i was older than one teacher and a month apart in age from another - but i remained excited to be there.) i even studied abroad when i was 34. the collective group of study abroad students at the university in quito was about 40 students, and i was over a decade older than all of them! so group activities for the abroad group weren't usually my speed, but ai did make friends there. i also ventured out on my own a lot and found friends my own age. 

the point is - it's your life and you don't have to follow a generic timeline that you think is what people 'should' do. also - you can't go back and change things or start school earlier or whatever. your circumstances brought you to where you are now, and it is what it is. so the question you ask yourself is do you want a college degree? because if you do - then get it and don't worry about being 4 or 5 years older than the other students. honestly, being only 25 - your classmates prob don't even know you're several years older (unless you tell them.) not that you should be secretive about it, but it's also none of their business. be proud of yourself for getting your degree especially having to do it a little older, and if age comes up, consider that you may be inspiring to them. in grad school i made friends with a classmate who is 7 years younger than me, and he felt old and a little discouraged for being in grad school in his 30s- but he saw that i was excited to be doing it in my 40s and it inspired him, and he admired me for it. there were 5 of us from one class that formed a little group and we are all still friends to this day - our ages are 27, 28, 30, 36, and me at 43 - and these are some of the best people i know and i love this group! 

you can be discouraged and drag yourself through, or you can accept that this is where you're at and enjoy it and be proud of what you're accomplishing period. who cares about age?

i initially went in to college thinking i’ll major in business. i have since thought about changing it to interior design or nursing. all very different i know. interior design is something i think i will like given i do like decorating/designing rooms. i am nervous interior design is not going to be good money. nursing really is because of the money although i would not be interested in bedside nursing and would maybe do something else with it. nursing school also makes me very nervous. 

 either way, i’m still so torn on what to do and have been stalling in school because i’m so unsure on my major. i feel like i’m running out of time and getting so overwhelmed that i’m now 24 and still have not graduated. seeing all of my high school friends graduating or graduated already. my parents asking me when i am going to finish school. i know i want to finish school. if i don’t go to school i have absolutely no idea what i would do. going to college has been the only thing i’ve ever thought of doing. i just want a career that makes good money and is comfortable. i just have no idea what to do. any advice?

so i went in the final exam not knowing the minimum needed for me to pass the class, even though i think i did well on the 2nd midterm.

1. qualifying for pell grants and going to a cheap enough college it covers all or most of the cost.

2. scholarships, either private or through the university/college. you can apply for more scholarships at any point during or before college!

3. employers that offer tuition payment/reimbursement as a benefit.

4. cheap school + lots of savings. might be combined with living with family or other cheap/rent-free living arrangements.

5. part-time school rather than full-time (costs more in the long run but cheaper in the short term so easier to pay) and payment plans.

i went to community college, then transferred to a cheap public university in-state. i qualify for the full pell grant which covers the majority of tuition. the rest i’ve paid for through small scholarships and my savings from working part time. i live with family to reduce living expenses.

first, you’ll be doing clinicals for nursing or med school. so even though you say you want obgyn, until you get into the clinic you  won’t actually know what works for you. almost everyone changes their specialty during clinicals

you can apply to med school with a nursing degree, you’ll mostly likely need a few extra classes but you can 

if you want a nursing degree another option to save money is get your adn at your community college, work as a nurse to see if you even like it, then get your adn-rn bridge degree 

this will also save you a lot of money if you’re paying for school yourself, plus a lot of hospitals will pay for you to get your rn so that’s something you can look into during job hunting 

but i really wouldn’t stress right now about getting into med school or getting your doctorate in nursing. you can’t even get a masters in nursing until you work as a nurse

3661,t1_l13igcw,1713989661.0,"it is difficult to go to college without taking out some loans, that's just life (unless you can afford to pay out of pocket, but it sounds like you can't.) scholarships and grants can help, but there will often be a balance due. it sucks, but it is what it is. 

refusing to take out loans is a little extreme. if you want to get a degree, it costs money. if you don't have the money and can't get enough in scholarships, you have to borrow it. it's like saying ""i really want a new car but i refuse to take out a loan and i can't afford to pay for it with cash. how can i make this happen?"" lol definitely apply for grants and scholarships, but those can be a lot of work and you may not get enough to cover everything. i recommend a cheaper school too, as most jobs don't require a fancy university, they just want to know you have a degree.

to start - fill out the fafsa. this will tell you if you qualify for a federal grant or any federal loans (which you obviously don't want, but may need.) beyond that, google grants for college, scholarships for college. do that to find a wide variety of options, then google again and add your city, state, and/or major to the searches to see if there are specific ones in your location or for your specific degree. if you know what school, see what scholarships the school offers. if you are dead set against loans, make sure you know if you can get thru the whole program on those funds before you start or you might spend a couple years in school just to have to stop if the fund run out.

i am not considering microbiology and immunology. that way id be more likely to get a job after college. my goal is to be able to work in research on my condition or in virology.

3711,t3_1ccbu5y,1713998266.0,"okay so for some background information, i am currently struggling with my life 102 class. i had to retake it this semester because i had an evil professor that failed more than half the class last time i took it. i have already submitted for repeat/repair and this life 102 course has way more work and is a lot harder. i have been dealing with some difficulties this semester and had to work harder to ensure that i pass my other difficult classes. i will admit that i have missed some assignments because of there being just so many.

i have tried to work with the professor, and she explains how there is a late policy of 1 day late means you get 75% and two days means you get 50%. she also explained that this applies to most assignments accept for the post-labs, exams, that stuff. totally fine, some percent is better than nothing right? except for the fact that all of a sudden, the assignment locks the moment it is due a few weeks into the semester and there is no way to even complete it for late grading. the professor hasn't really acknowledged this when i have tried to bring it up and suggested that i try to use a schedule to complete assignments on time. i did not come on this thread to complain about my problems it and i know i'm extremely lucky to even get the opportunity to go to college. it's been really difficult trying to navigate college as a first-generation student and i keep asking myself if this is all actually worth it?

anyways, even when i do complete assignments despite knowing the material i still struggle with getting everything right, so i get like b+ or b- or c+ on the assignments i turn in. which you think would at least boost the percentage or increase the grade at least a little bit. however, my grade percentage keeps going down regardless of whether i get an a on an assignment or if i get a c+. this is really frustrating because i spend a lot of time trying to succeed in this class. i do not want to fail this class and have been participating more than the students who are getting better grades. is there something i am missing or is it my own fault? i could really use some advice because i just want to curl up and cry at this point. i've reached to my professor yet again, but it takes forever to get a response usually. any advice or explanation would be helpful!",2024-04-24 18:37:46,"['okay', 'background', 'inform', 'current', 'struggl', 'life', 'class', 'retak', 'semest', 'evil', 'professor', 'fail', 'more_than', 'half', 'class', 'last', 'time', 'took', 'alreadi', 'submit', 'repeat/repair', 'life', 'cours', 'work', 'a_lot', 'harder', 'deal', 'difficulti', 'semest', 'work', 'harder', 'ensur', 'pass', 'difficult', 'class', 'admit', 'miss', 'assign', 'mani', 'tri', 'work', 'professor', 'explain', 'late', 'polici', 'late', 'mean', 'day', 'mean', 'also', 'explain', 'appli', 'assign', 'accept', 'post-lab', 'exam', 'stuff', 'total', 'fine', 'percent', 'better', 'noth', 'right', 'except', 'fact', 'sudden', 'assign', 'lock', 'moment', 'a_few', 'week', 'semest', 'even', 'complet', 'late', 'grade', 'professor', 'realli', 'acknowledg', 'tri', 'bring', 'suggest', 'schedul', 'complet', 'assign', 'time', 'come', 'thread', 'complain', 'problem', 'know', 'extrem', 'lucki', 'even', 'opportun', 'colleg', ""it_'"", 'realli', 'difficult', 'tri', 'navig', 'colleg', 'first-gener', 'student', 'keep', 'ask', 'actual', 'worth', 'anyway', 'even', 'complet', 'assign', 'despit', 'know', 'materi', 'still', 'struggl', 'get', 'everyth', 'right', 'like', 'assign', 'turn', 'think', 'would', 'at_least', 'boost', 'percentag', 'increas', 'grade', 'at_least', 'littl', 'howev', 'grade', 'percentag', 'keep', 'go', 'regardless', 'whether', 'assign', 'realli', 'frustrat', 'spend', 'a_lot', 'time', 'tri', 'succeed', 'class', 'want', 'fail', 'class', 'particip', 'more_than', 'student', 'get', 'better', 'grade', 'someth', 'miss', 'fault', 'could', 'realli', 'advic', 'want', 'curl', 'point', 'reach', 'professor', 'take', 'forev', 'respons', 'usual', 'any_advic', 'explan', 'would', 'help']","[(0, 2), (5, 2), (18, 1), (33, 2), (34, 1), (35, 3), (36, 2), (43, 1), (45, 1), (51, 1), (55, 4), (57, 1), (58, 1), (66, 3), (75, 3), (78, 1), (86, 1), (103, 5), (105, 2), (107, 3), (113, 1), (121, 1), (127, 1), (134, 1), (135, 3), (136, 2), (138, 3), (139, 1), (149, 1), (154, 2), (155, 1), (158, 1), (160, 2), (171, 1), (179, 2), (182, 4), (194, 1), (195, 1), (196, 1), (201, 1), (203, 1), (207, 1), (218, 1), (227, 2), (229, 1), (240, 1), (248, 1), (252, 2), (253, 1), (259, 1), (260, 1), (283, 1), (292, 1), (305, 1), (316, 1), (326, 1), (347, 1), (348, 1), (361, 2), (368, 1), (371, 2), (377, 2), (378, 1), (393, 1), (397, 1), (407, 1), (413, 1), (422, 2), (427, 1), (428, 1), (434, 2), (466, 4), (480, 1), (504, 1), (506, 1), (515, 2), (522, 2), (533, 1), (540, 1), (554, 1), (558, 4), (559, 1), (603, 2), (607, 1), (642, 1), (643, 7), (651, 1), (676, 1), (692, 1), (722, 1), (731, 1), (734, 1), (753, 1), (775, 1), (787, 2), (823, 1), (828, 1), (839, 1), (860, 1), (901, 1), (922, 1), (933, 1), (934, 1)]",[0.01273885 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

i'm going to college for environmental science. my parents wanted me to go to a very small local (10 minutes away) *very* religious school. they had me apply to a few others as well and i was accepted everywhere they had me apply to but i never was really interested. my mother especially is more concerned about how devoutly christian a school is than the experiences/opportunities/what i want etc. i dont even consider myself christian anymore, although she wouldn't know that. if i was going for something else it would be more bearable, but i was homeschooled all my life and i really don't want 4 more years of creationist science..

 i was accepted with a full tuition scholarship i managed to get at a slightly farther away and much less strictly religious school that i really wanted to go to. i was so excited when i won the full tuition i worked really hard on my application and interviews and no one even cared. my entire family is disappointed in me and it took weeks of arguing for them to even let me go. i just paid the deposit, well asked my dad to, and i feel so awful for disappointing them even though i know id be miserable if i just did what they wanted. asking my dad for $200 to do something he doesn't even want me to do feels awful. i know ill be an adult and its my education my future and i cant let other people control my decisions because im scared to upset people my whole life but it really sucks. and i really didn't want to have to pay tens of thousands of dollars to go somewhere else when i have an option where everything's paid for. it seems like the best choice in every way other than my parents disapproval.

did anyone else go through something like this, does it get better or go away? i want to be excited and happy about this but i feel so awful and scared of how everyone will react that i cant be. i know this is what i want to do, but i didn't want to be a problem you know? how do i get over it?",2024-04-24 19:24:08,"['sorri', 'realli', 'sure', 'best', 'place', 'littl', 'desper', 'peopl', 'input', 'go', 'colleg', 'environment', 'scienc', 'my_par', 'want', 'small', 'local', 'minut', 'away', 'religi', 'school', 'appli', 'a_few', 'other', 'as_wel', 'accept', 'everywher', 'appli', 'never', 'realli', 'interest', 'mother', 'especi', 'concern', 'devoutli', 'christian', 'school', 'experiences/opportunities/what', 'want', 'dont', 'even', 'consid', 'christian', 'anymor', 'although', 'would', 'know', 'go', 'someth', 'els', 'would', 'bearabl', 'homeschool', 'life', 'realli', ""do_n't"", 'want', 'year', 'creationist', 'scienc', 'accept', 'full', 'tuition', 'scholarship', 'manag', 'slightli', 'farther', 'away', 'much', 'less', 'strictli', 'religi', 'school', 'realli', 'want', 'excit', 'full', 'tuition', 'work', 'realli', 'hard', 'applic', 'interview', 'even', 'care', 'entir', 'famili', 'disappoint', 'took', 'week', 'argu', 'even', 'paid', 'deposit', 'well', 'ask', 'feel', 'aw', 'disappoint', 'even_though', 'know', 'miser', 'want', 'ask', 'someth', ""does_n't"", 'even', 'want', 'feel', 'aw', 'know', 'adult', 'educ', 'futur', 'cant', 'peopl', 'control', 'decis', 'scare', 'upset', 'peopl', 'whole', 'life', 'realli', 'suck', 'realli', ""did_n't"", 'want', 'ten', 'thousand', 'dollar', 'somewher', 'els', 'option', 'everyth', 'paid', 'seem', 'like', 'best', 'choic', 'everi', 'my_par', 'disapprov', 'anyon', 'els', 'someth', 'like', 'better', 'away', 'want', 'excit', 'happi', 'feel', 'aw', 'scare', 'everyon', 'react', 'cant', 'know', 'want', ""did_n't"", 'want', 'problem', 'know']","[(5, 1), (23, 1), (31, 3), (36, 10), (37, 1), (58, 2), (84, 1), (107, 4), (108, 3), (113, 2), (118, 1), (121, 1), (134, 1), (135, 1), (136, 2), (141, 1), (142, 1), (145, 2), (149, 3), (156, 1), (162, 1), (167, 1), (171, 2), (182, 7), (184, 1), (192, 1), (196, 2), (198, 1), (199, 2), (202, 1), (203, 2), (221, 1), (222, 1), (225, 1), (237, 1), (246, 1), (252, 5), (253, 1), (263, 1), (284, 1), (289, 1), (307, 3), (314, 1), (325, 1), (326, 1), (356, 1), (359, 2), (377, 1), (384, 3), (387, 2), (388, 3), (390, 2), (427, 1), (430, 1), (437, 2), (463, 1), (464, 1), (465, 1), (497, 1), (501, 1), (517, 1), (522, 2), (532, 1), (568, 1), (572, 1), (581, 1), (588, 1), (609, 1), (616, 1), (617, 1), (676, 1), (694, 1), (702, 1), (703, 1), (763, 2), (766, 2), (808, 1), (854, 2), (883, 1), (895, 1), (918, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

my one class is very unforgiving as a full-time worker. there is a quiz every class, we have 4 projects to do throughout the semester, and a ""field journal"" where we get docked points if sketches are ""lazy"". attendance is apart of a grade. my professor sent me an email saying i was failing this class and that basically i couldnt fix it.

my other class is math and i am horrid at math. im floating at a high c right now. i have a ""midterm"" tomorrow. im not confident im passing this class either.

the other class is really chill, i have an a in it. i basically just have to show up and its fine.

im probably going to be moving soon and im struggling to see a point to even continue this semester if im going to fail 2/3 classes. i might transfer to an online school if i can find one in environmental sciences cause in person just doesnt work for me.

that’s a great deal, but the problem is that i’ve found myself currently in thousands of dollars of debt for personal family reasons i’m not getting into. (but yes, they’re medical bills). i’m also not likely to get much fafsa aide if any because i grew up middle class. so even if i’m in a really bad place financially right now and my parents give a lot of their income to care for a grandparent, they’ll see how much my parents make on paper and think i’m rolling in dough. 

i seriously don’t know what to do. my parents have been allowing my partner and i to live with them after we got f-ed over by our old apartment, but the deal is that it’s mostly just until i finish school. they’re kind people and i find this entirely reasonable. i have no idea how a gap year will factor into that cause none of us ever considered needing to do this. there’s no way i can make enough money to pay off those bills and save for a down payment to get out of my parents’ hair afterwards while in school full time. but it’s also possible they’ll want us to find our own place if i’m not actively in school and that would defeat the whole purpose.

3755,t3_1ccdmw2,1714003114.0,"   i feel like i am struggling a lot, no, truly, i am. at first everything was sailing smoothly for the most part, all of the frustration from errors was all deserved on my end, such as having a missing grad for my midterm essay because i misses the part where it said it could not be late, and of course that was consciously the one time decision i made to accept a point deduction on a late grade just so i could make sure my formatting was proper for apa and that ny citations where in order, you know why? a previous mistake i made, the first of many i'm sure. i was struggling trying to find out the proper citation formatting for when referring to court and legal cases. 

   the way i process knowledge and new information may be different than most, i like to find a relation to what i'm learning to my everyday life, like if i've had an experience related to that topic or maybe it was something i vaguely remember reading about in 10th grade. i am fully aware and can recognize that yes, there may be times where my writing to the average neurotypical may feel like it's unrelated to the context, but often it is not that far off because typically they understand the overall point of what i'm saying aside from the 3 random sentences of how my brain decided to process and apply this knowledge to something i'm familiar with.

   today after receiving an email from a professor, i feel more frustrated than ever and it feels like i'm being dismissed in a way almost. we had a discussion board of questions that overall related to gender identy and transgender people, like giving examples of how you can be respectful and knowledgeable when interacting with someone who has a different gender identity, identifying things you would probably have in common with a transgender person, and even the impact of social microagressions. clearly, she already had a predetermined answer for a subjective topic. 
   i know the answer she was looking for focused on the mental health aspect of being transgender, the likelihood of depression and how the statistics of suicide rates increase. i know it, my friends know, anyone with common sense knows it. the issue was, i posed a separate issue to this perspective that is often overlooked, which is bodily mutilation, and i don't mean that in a derogatory manner because i support medical transitioning, but the relationship this has is when people have this expectation of how transgender people should look, what they do medically and/or surgically, etc. you are pushing this narrative of how you think it should be.
    the microagressions of invasive questions, asking whether or not someone has had 'the' surgery, that is the reality of it. i had included a link to information about 'safe' phalloplasty procedures, which included images that showed the stages of the surgery. mind you, again, it was a link and i didn't just upload a bunch of graphic images in my text itself, i had also included a note that it was nsfw and graphic, that it a genital based procedure, so there is genitalia, thinking, this is okay because we are all adults and we are grown enough to have serious discussions over these topics, and apparently i was wrong. she told me that the images were graphic and unrelated to the discussion. again, let's remember that i added a note by the link that explicitly stated that there was graphic surgical images but by clicking that link you consensually made that decision to view that.

   i don't feel it comes for an egotistical standpoint that i have to be right or i have to get the last word in, because that's not the case at all. i feel that there is a form of bitter irony here though, considering this is a cultural and ethnic identity class, and we have had assignments to look at our identities, especially as white people, to recognize our white privilege, the stages of racism, how being passive isn't the better solution, and just being able to look at a variety of topics especially in the sense of marginalized groups and communities, but how are you going to go out of your way to tell your only transgender student that this is unrelated, when this is an experience that you have probably never witnessed or are completely unaware of? it felt so dismissive and invalidating to have her email me that, but also didn't quite say what could be better or what to avoid doing. they always just make comments that something went off topic, but they don't give anymore context beyond that and it's frustrating because then i don't understand what i can potentially fix on my end to do better to upholds the neurotypical standard.",2024-04-24 19:58:34,"['feel_lik',

3810,t1_l1515o7,1714009911.0,"i'm sorry that you are having a tough time and that you feel like your experiences are being invalidated. one downside of courses like these is that they often assume no one in the course is actually from the minority group being discussed and assignments can be written in a way that alienate actual minorities.

although i am not your instructor, perhaps i can shed a little light on why this may be happening--though, you should always follow up with your instructor, asking if they can clarify their exact expectations. i'm just going with what i assume happened.

i teach literature and often cover texts that have issues concerning gender, race, class, etc. and i have discussion questions on how the text handles those issues. it's not uncommon for a student to talk about the social issue in general, but not *how the text deals with it*. for example, we'll cover a text that deals with gender--but doesn't mention motherhood--and i have students write about how women were expected to do nothing but have babies.  it's not that this is a bad or totally irrelevant point in the larger scheme of gender roles--but that's not what we're focusing on, so it's not the time to comment that. for many instructors, the point of discussion questions is largely so the professor can evaluate how well you're engaging with the materials in the class itself.

it sounds like something like this may have happened. your instructor was expecting engagement with the main talking points of the course, and you brought in a subject that was related, but not reflective of the course itself. the topic of surgery, how it's done, etc., are related to the topic of transgenderism--but it's not what your course is about. discussions of the surgery, it's safety, etc., do not show you understand the concepts of the class itself. as for the images themselves, i do think it is important to remember that many people are sensitive to surgical images. your instructor needs to check the link you provided in order to fully grade your post. so even if you warn that it's nsfw, they have to check it whether they want to see that kind of stuff or not.

this may sound contradictory, but in the future don't think of your discussion posts as *discussions*. discussions involve bringing in new perspectives and generally related info. instead, think of them more like reports.

so instead of saying ""microaggressions can be related to issues concerning surgery. here's some more info on surgery so you understand why this is such a big deal"" you might say something like ""microaggressions can be related to issues concerning surgery. here's why it is a microaggression to ask if someone has had surgery. i can empathize with this because people talking about my body would make me uncomfortable."" if you're openly trans in the class you may instead say something about why you wouldn't ask other trans people about their surgery status, or you might say ""here's why cisgender people can relate to this: they also would be uncomfortable if someone asked them about their bodies."" it's more boring and less conversational to write it this way, but it's showing you can mirror the ideas of the class back at the instructor. 

again, check with your instructor for further feedback. you may ask if they can give you feedback on your next post before you make it. don't be afraid to ask follow up questions if you don't understand their feedback.",2024-04-24 21:51:51,"['sorri', 'tough', 'time', 'feel_lik', 'experi', 'invalid', 'downsid', 'cours', 'like', 'often', 'assum', 'cours', 'actual', 'minor', 'group', 'discuss', 'assign', 'written', 'alien', 'actual', 'minor', 'although', 'instructor', 'perhap', 'shed', 'littl', 'light', 'happen', 'though', 'alway', 'follow', 'instructor', 'ask', 'clarifi', 'exact', 'expect', 'go', 'assum', 'happen', 'teach', 'literatur', 'often', 'cover', 'text', 'issu', 'concern', 'gender', 'race', 'class', 'discuss', 'question', 'text', 'handl', 'issu', ""it_'"", 'uncommon', 'student', 'talk', 'social', 'issu', 'gener', 'text', 'deal', 'exampl', 'cover', 'text', 'deal', 'gender', ""does_n't"", 'mention', 'motherhood', 'student', 'write', 'women', 'expect', 'noth', 'babi', ""it_'"", 'total', 'irrelev', 'point', 'larger', 'scheme', 'gender', 'role', 'focus', ""it_'"", 'time', 'comment', 'mani', 'instructor', 'point', 'discuss', 'question', 'larg', 'professor', 'evalu', 'well', ""you_'r"", 'engag', 'materi', 'class', 'sounds_lik', 'someth', 'like', 'happen', 'instructor', 'expect', 'engag', 'main', 'talk', 'point', 'cours', 'brought', 'subject', 'relat', 'reflect', 'cours', 'topic', 'surgeri', ""it_'"", 'done', 'etc.', 'relat', 'topic', 'transgender', ""it_'"", 'cours', 'discuss', 'surgeri', ""it_'"", 'safeti', 'etc.', 'show', 'understand', 'concept', 'class', 'imag', 'think', 'import', 'rememb', 'mani', 'peopl', 'sensit', 'surgic', 'imag', 'instructor', 'need', 'check', 'link', 'provid', 'order', 'fulli', 'grade', 'post', 'even', 'warn', ""it_'"", 'nsfw', 'check', 'whether', 'want', 'kind_of', 'stuff', 'sound', 'contradictori', 'futur', ""do_n't"", 'think', 'discuss', 'post', 'discuss', 'discuss', 'involv', 'bring', 'perspect', 'gener', 'relat', 'info', 'instead', 'think', 'like', 'report', 'instead', 'say', 'microaggress', 'relat', 'issu', 'concern', 'surgeri', 'info', 'surgeri', 'understand', 'deal', 'might', 'someth', 'like', 'microaggress', 'relat', 'issu', 'concern', 'surgeri', 'microaggress', 'someon', 'surgeri', 'empath', 'peopl', 'talk', 'bodi', 'would', 'make', 'uncomfort', ""you_'r"", 'openli', 'tran', 'class', 'instead', 'someth', 'would', 'tran', 'peopl', 'surgeri', 'statu', 'might', 'cisgend', 'peopl', 'relat', 'also', 'would', 'uncomfort', 'someon', 'ask', 'bodi', ""it_'"", 'bore', 'less', 'convers', 'write', ""it_'"", 'show', 'mirror', 'idea', 'class', 'back', 'instructor', 'check', 'instructor', 'feedback', 'give', 'feedback', 'next', 'post', 'make', ""do_n't"", 'afraid', 'follow', 'question', ""do_n't"", 'understand', 'feedback']","[(17, 2), (25, 3), (26, 3), (33, 2), (35, 2), (36, 1), (48, 1), (54, 3), (57, 1), (58, 2), (59, 1), (68, 1), (74, 1), (84, 3), (86, 2), (88, 1), (100, 2), (103, 5), (107, 1), (113, 1), (127, 1), (129, 1), (132, 3), (136, 3), (144, 2), (149, 3), (157, 2), (162, 1), (172, 3), (176, 3), (195, 9), (196, 4), (204, 1), (210, 1), (222, 1), (229, 3), (253, 1), (258, 2), (260, 1), (266, 1), (283, 2), (286, 1), (290, 1), (304, 3), (308, 5), (311, 1), (312, 1), (325, 1), (329, 2), (339, 1), (360, 3), (368, 1), (378, 5), (379, 1), (383, 2), (386, 1), (388, 4), (397, 1), (417, 1), (463, 1), (465, 1), (466, 1), (472, 1), (481, 2), (506, 3), (517, 1), (519, 1), (528, 2), (530, 2), (533, 3), (543, 1), (551, 1), (558, 1), (581, 3), (587, 2), (593, 1), (602, 1), (612, 1), (615, 7), (643, 1), (650, 2), (654, 1), (660, 1), (670, 2), (681, 1), (692, 1), (696, 1), (708, 1), (726, 4), (730, 6), (732, 2), (767, 1), (773, 1), (776, 1), (781, 1), (845, 7), (855, 1), (860, 1), (864, 1), (885, 2), (886, 1), (938, 1), (961, 1), (972, 1), (1002, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

stop focusing on when you graduate (age) and things you can’t change in the past or control i.e your grad salary or grad job. instead focus on getting the best grades you can, relevant work experience or internships and be focused towards your other goals (health etc). consider getting medicated for adhd. the things you can control and will increase the probability of you getting your other goals. there is no guarantee as timing and luck are huge part also be realistic and get the best role you can. do your best to focus on the journey not the destination.

another common issue is coming underprepared for class. you mentioned not understanding what’s happening in the classroom. if there are assigned readings, are you doing those beforehand? do you ever look up anything outside of class to see if an alternate presentation of the material makes more sense to you?

if homework is an issue for you, do you start assignments early enough that you have time to ask questions before the due date? do plan enough time into your schedule that you can complete assignments without rushing through them?

i also find that many students do not reach out until it’s too late in the semester to raise their grade/really engage with the material. do you ask questions during class or attend office hours? have you emailed any professors or tas with questions? are there tutoring sessions you can attend? could you form a study group?

college can be a big adjustment and many students do not take to it easily, but don’t let this stop you if it’s something you want to pursue (and can afford right now). this is only your first semester, so you have a lot of time to turn it around. consider taking a reduced course load next semester if it doesn’t affect your financials.  and definitely take some time to reflect before the next semester on where you can improve your engagement/efficiency in your studies.",2024-04-24 22:58:35,"['a_few', 'thing', 'could', 'go', 'first', 'a_lot', 'peopl', 'come', 'colleg', 'without', 'real', 'studi', 'skill', 'studi', 'skill', 'learn', 'mani', 'school', 'page', 'somewher', 'websit', 'resourc', 'bunch', 'googl', 'studi', 'strategies.', 'anoth', 'common', 'issu', 'come', 'underprepar', 'class', 'mention', 'understand', 'happen', 'classroom', 'assign', 'read', 'beforehand', 'ever', 'look', 'anyth', 'outsid', 'class', 'altern', 'present', 'materi', 'make', 'sens', 'homework', 'issu', 'staassign', 'earli', 'enough', 'time', 'question', 'date', 'plan', 'enough', 'time', 'schedul', 'complet', 'assign', 'without', 'rush', 'also', 'find', 'mani', 'student', 'reach', 'too_lat', 'semest', 'rais', 'grade/r', 'engag', 'materi', 'question', 'class', 'attend', 'office_hour', 'email', 'professor', 'question', 'tutor', 'session', 'attend', 'could', 'form', 'studi', 'group', 'colleg', 'adjust', 'mani', 'student', 'take', 'easili', 'don_’', 'stop', 'someth', 'want', 'pursu', 'afford', 'right_now', 'first', 'semest', 'a_lot', 'time', 'turn', 'around', 'consid', 'take', 'reduc', 'cours', 'load', 'next', 'semest', 'doesn_’', 'affect', 'financi', 'definit', 'take', 'time', 'reflect', 'next', 'semest', 'improv', 'engagement/effici', 'studi']","[(0, 2), (5, 2), (11, 2), (26, 3), (31, 1), (33, 2), (35, 4), (36, 1), (41, 2), (46, 1), (47, 1), (49, 1), (51, 1), (57, 1), (75, 4), (78, 3), (86, 3), (88, 2), (97, 1), (103, 3), (106, 1), (110, 1), (113, 1), (114, 1), (132, 1), (138, 1), (139, 2), (143, 1), (144, 1), (149, 1), (153, 1), (166, 5), (183, 1), (186, 1), (188, 2), (206, 1), (217, 1), (220, 1), (233, 1), (235, 1), (280, 2), (284, 1), (292, 2), (303, 1), (308, 2), (309, 1), (310, 1), (334, 1), (360, 1), (378, 1), (388, 1), (408, 1), (413, 1), (416, 1), (426, 1), (429, 1), (454, 1), (470, 1), (474, 1), (502, 1), (550, 1), (551, 1), (558, 1), (559, 1), (639, 1), (643, 2), (660, 1), (668, 1), (669, 1), (676, 1), (738, 1), (764, 1), (812, 1), (814, 1), (817, 1), (824, 1), (860, 2), (863, 2), (895, 1), (907, 1), (962, 1), (996, 1)]",[0.01754386 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

next, i'd really analyze if school is for you. a lot of people go into school just because that's what you do, but for a lot of people it's just not for them. take a year and try a bunch of new stuff. many recommend trade school, which can be good for some, bad for others. you might be able to get an apprenticeship, which can give you a ton of opportunities. if you decide on the military path, go airforce, and get a technical job. these jobs pay the best and translate the best to civilian work. you can also just get an entry level job. sales is the highest paying, but plenty of other roles can provide fulfilling work. it's just about finding what you enjoy.

problem is now i am a 3rd year biology major with an absolutely tanked gpa. i have failed so many classes since switching my major and the problem is i still have no idea what i wanna do with my life. my mental health is just as bad as ever, just now i'm three years deep in something else i am not sure what i am doing with. every single chem class i have taken has whooped my ass, and i still have more to go. i wanted to so something post-grad, but my gpa and garbage transcript makes me feel like i really have no future in this field. i tried to reapply the arts program because i missed it and felt concern about the shift in major last year (2nd semester sophomore year), but they rejected my application as my gpa was too low (2.8)

my parents want me to try to finish the degree out just because i have already invested so much time and money into it. my partner hates that i have no plan for the future, and wants me to change my major again and pursue something i am actually passionate about (i have absolutely no clue what else i could do with my life). none of my friends here support me either, none of them are surprised when i fail another class and are constantly telling me that i am wasting my time with this and they can't wait for me to wake up. i feel absolutely lost. anyone with life experience please give me advice i am so distraught.",2024-04-25 02:01:23,"['first', 'enrol', 'colleg', 'freshman', '2021', 'start', 'school', 'afound', 'program', 'no_idea', 'would', 'futur', 'knew', 'love', 'creat', 'appli', 'luckili', 'accept', 'semest', 'decid', 'mental_health', 'great', 'think', 'might', 'lack', 'direct', 'want', 'chang', 'major', 'pursu', 'someth', 'medic', 'seriou', 'help', 'peopl', 'told', 'my_par', 'idea', 'super', 'support', 'perfectli', 'happi', 'amajor', 'incred', 'support', 'endeavor', 'grate', 'problem', 'year', 'biolog', 'major', 'absolut', 'tank', 'fail', 'mani', 'class', 'sinc', 'switch', 'major', 'problem', 'still', 'no_idea', 'wan_na', 'life', 'mental_health', 'ever', 'three', 'year', 'deep', 'someth', 'els', 'not_sur', 'everi', 'singl', 'chem', 'class', 'taken', 'whoop', 'still', 'want', 'someth', 'post-grad', 'garbag', 'transcript', 'make', 'feel_lik', 'realli', 'futur', 'field', 'tri', 'reappli', 'art', 'program', 'miss', 'felt', 'concern', 'shift', 'major', 'last', 'year', 'semest', 'sophomor', 'year', 'reject', 'applic', 'my_par', 'want', 'finish', 'degre', 'alreadi', 'invest', 'so_much', 'time', 'money', 'partner', 'hate', 'plan', 'futur', 'want', 'chang', 'major', 'pursu', 'someth', 'actual', 'passion', 'absolut', 'clue', 'els', 'could', 'life', 'none', 'friend', 'suppom', 'either', 'none', 'surpris', 'fail', 'anoth', 'class', 'constantli', 'tell', 'wast', 'time', ""ca_n't"", 'wait', 'wake', 'feel', 'absolut', 'lost', 'anyon', 'life', 'experi', 'pleas', 'give', 'advic', 'distraught']","[(5, 1), (7, 1), (11, 1), (19, 1), (31, 1), (35, 2), (36, 4), (37, 4), (38, 2), (49, 1), (55, 1), (60, 1), (62, 1), (75, 2), (76, 1), (85, 1), (86, 1), (91, 1), (102, 1), (103, 3), (108, 1), (112, 1), (121, 2), (128, 1), (133, 1), (136, 1), (139, 1), (144, 1), (145, 2), (149, 4), (155, 1), (171, 1), (175, 1), (182, 1), (194, 1), (201, 1), (202, 1), (203, 1), (204, 1), (206, 1), (224, 1), (226, 1), (229, 1), (246, 1), (259, 2), (278, 1), (283, 1), (307, 2), (314, 1), (316, 1), (329, 1), (346, 1), (351, 1), (361, 1), (365, 2), (373, 5), (379, 1), (388, 1), (410, 1), (421, 1), (422, 2), (432, 1), (433, 1), (435, 1), (438, 1), (446, 1), (447, 1), (449, 1), (465, 3), (487, 1), (519, 1), (520, 1), (522, 3), (523, 1), (534, 2), (536, 3), (581, 1), (691, 1), (696, 1), (729, 1), (733, 2), (744, 1), (761, 1), (764, 1), (783, 1), (798, 1), (808, 1), (811, 1), (812, 2), (827, 1), (830, 1), (836, 1), (848, 1), (870, 1), (894, 2), (898, 1), (910, 1), (923, 1), (928, 1), (931, 2), (941, 1), (943, 1), (949, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

edit: also, get a summer job that allows you to work 40 hours a week and work as many weeks there as possible, like start right from the monday after high school graduation and work right up until the friday before you move to college. i’d recommend trying to get something over $13 an hour for the summer if you can. it sounds rough working full time but having the same routine every day is a lot like the high school schedule and having that routine can be easier than the ups and downs of college at times.

i found it hard to work more than 15 hours a week while in college, so once you’re there, try to find something with a high enough wage and definitely don’t settle for anything below $10-11. you can probably look on handshake and apply to things during the summer so you can start work asap and make as much money as possible.

the biggest thing is living expenses. if you can live at home, you have no idea how much money that will save you. i would do it. if you can’t do that, financial aid and scholarships will cover part of the dorms while living expenses will be out of your own pocket. do the math and figure out the cheapest option.

full disclosure, i got lucky and ended up having a surprise college fund from a relative that i didn’t find out about until the summer before college, but i still did all of these things to ensure i wouldn’t struggle financially. there are ways to do it but it’s hard. you should strongly consider how worth it the program is. i disagree with the sentiment that community college classes are “just as good” if you feel more at home and might learn better at the more expensive place; you’re investing in yourself and you pretty much get one shot at undergrad so you might as well go big or go home. and $15k a year is not that bad; that’s a little more than what i had to pay. you do need a lot of passion to make it work though.",2024-04-25 02:14:16,"['take', 'advantag', 'school', 'career', 'center', 'resourc', 'articl', 'onlin', 'teach', 'appli', 'scholarship', 'appli', 'high_school', 'senior', 'think', 'scholarship', 'total', 'around', '3200', 'scholarship', 'season', 'january-februari', 'might', 'slow', 'probabl', 'take', 'loan', 'first', 'year', 'appli', 'scholarship', 'follow', 'year', 'cover', 'rest', 'realli', 'good', 'system', 'appli', 'scholarship', 'send', 'resourc', 'want', 'even', 'help', 'find', 'good', 'program', 'state', 'would', 'open', 'also', 'scholarship', 'offer', 'return', 'student', 'depart', 'reappli', 'year', 'edit', 'also', 'summer', 'allow', 'work', 'hour', 'week', 'work', 'mani', 'week', 'possibl', 'like', 'staright', 'monday', 'high_school', 'graduat', 'work', 'right', 'friday', 'move', 'colleg', 'recommend', 'tri', 'someth', 'hour', 'summer', 'sound', 'rough', 'work', 'full_tim', 'the_sam', 'routin', 'everi', 'a_lot', 'like', 'high_school', 'schedul', 'routin', 'easier', 'down', 'colleg', 'time', 'found', 'hard', 'work', 'more_than', 'hour', 'week', 'colleg', '’_re', 'find', 'someth', 'high', 'enough', 'wage', 'definit', 'don_’', 'settl', 'anyth', '10-11', 'probabl', 'look', 'handshak', 'appli', 'thing', 'summer', 'stawork', 'asap', 'make', 'much', 'money', 'possibl', 'biggest', 'thing', 'live', 'expens', 'live', 'home', 'no_idea', 'much', 'money', 'save', 'would', 'financial_aid', 'scholarship', 'cover', 'paof', 'dorm', 'live', 'expens', 'pocket', 'math', 'figure_out', 'cheapest', 'option', 'full', 'disclosur', 'lucki', 'ended_up', 'surpris', 'colleg', 'fund', 'rel', 'didn_’', 'find', 'summer', 'colleg', 'still', 'thing', 'ensur', 'wouldn_’', 'struggl', 'financi', 'way', 'hard', 'strongli', 'consid', 'worth', 'program', 'disagre', 'sentiment', 'community_colleg', 'class', 'good', 'feel', 'home', 'might', 'learn', 'better', 'expens', 'place', '’_re', 'invest', 'pretty_much', 'shot', 'undergrad', 'might', 'as_wel', 'home', 'year', 'littl', 'more_than', 'need', 'a_lot', 'passion', 'make', 'work', 'though']","[(0, 2), (4, 1), (5, 5), (10, 1), (11, 1), (19, 2), (22, 1), (23, 1), (29, 1), (30, 1), (31, 1), (33, 1), (35, 1), (36, 1), (37, 4), (44, 1), (46, 1), (51, 1), (53, 1), (55, 1), (57, 2), (68, 1), (71, 1), (78, 2), (80, 1), (81, 1), (83, 1), (86, 1), (103, 1), (107, 1), (108, 1), (110, 3), (111, 1), (120, 2), (129, 1), (134, 3), (135, 6), (136, 2), (143, 1), (144, 2), (147, 2), (149, 2), (153, 1), (157, 2), (159, 1), (160, 2), (165, 1), (182, 1), (184, 7), (186, 3), (194, 1), (196, 2), (203, 5), (225, 1), (227, 1), (228, 1), (229, 1), (234, 1), (235, 1), (236, 1), (249, 1), (253, 1), (254, 3), (257, 1), (259, 1), (260, 1), (263, 2), (271, 1), (275, 3), (280, 1), (284, 1), (287, 2), (295, 1), (298, 1), (303, 1), (310, 1), (314, 1), (321, 3), (329, 3), (343, 3), (353, 1), (354, 1), (358, 4), (365, 2), (367, 1), (377, 1), (404, 1), (407, 1), (412, 1), (429, 1), (439, 1), (450, 3), (464, 1), (483, 1), (485, 1), (486, 1), (501, 2), (507, 3), (515, 1), (543, 1), (550, 2), (556, 1), (557, 1), (591, 1), (620, 1), (654, 1), (656, 1), (670, 1), (677, 2), (723, 1), (766, 1), (811, 1), (813, 1), (894, 1), (899, 1), (903, 1), (929, 1), (949, 1), (953, 1), (988, 1)]",[0.01092896 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

my question is does anyone have experience with an independent study? i know it’s various by person but my degree is management information systems. it is also sometimes referred as computer information systems by other colleges and i’m going to graduate in the college of stem. my degree is a newish degree so they don’t have a dedicated senior seminar class so that’s why i have to do an independent study to substitute for that class. i already talked to a professor and they said they are willing to do it. i’m just wondering what it will exactly be about. i’d like to do networking since the professor i asked is a networking professor lol. any information would be helpful thank you all! god bless!",2024-04-25 03:45:36,"['hello', 'name', 'ethan', 'question', 'sorri', 'gon_na', 'complet', 'bachelor', 'degre', 'fall', '2024', 'faster', 'time', 'thought', 'complet', 'half', 'year', 'besid', 'point', 'question', 'anyon', 'experi', 'independ', 'studi', 'know', 'variou', 'person', 'degre', 'manag', 'inform', 'system', 'also', 'sometim', 'refer', 'comput', 'inform', 'system', 'colleg', 'go', 'graduat', 'colleg', 'stem', 'degre', 'newish', 'degre', 'don_’', 'dedic', 'senior', 'seminar', 'class', 'independ', 'studi', 'substitut', 'class', 'alreadi', 'talk', 'professor', 'said', 'will', 'wonder', 'exactli', 'like', 'network', 'sinc', 'professor', 'ask', 'network', 'professor', 'inform', 'would', 'help', 'thank', 'bless']","[(5, 2), (18, 3), (26, 2), (35, 1), (37, 1), (54, 1), (57, 1), (58, 1), (61, 1), (73, 1), (91, 1), (103, 2), (113, 1), (136, 1), (138, 2), (166, 2), (193, 1), (194, 1), (196, 1), (202, 1), (238, 1), (252, 1), (257, 1), (262, 2), (276, 1), (282, 1), (297, 1), (300, 1), (310, 1), (316, 1), (325, 1), (332, 1), (354, 1), (441, 1), (443, 1), (446, 4), (458, 1), (514, 1), (518, 1), (532, 1), (533, 1), (558, 3), (696, 1), (701, 2), (753, 1), (771, 1), (813, 2), (837, 1), (916, 1), (983, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]
3909,t3_1ccm6h1,1714031168.0,"hello! 

i have already talked to the chairman of the english department about this professor, although the issue was not resolved.

my online english professor does not post assignments for weeks at a time, does not post course material (no textbook), posts assignments with no clear instructions, does not answer emails.  

the first time we were without course work was 22 days, and i had emailed her 3 times within that timeframe with no response. i then emailed her boss concerned as she had stated she has medical issues and i was worried she may have had a medical emergency my college was unaware of. turns out, she was neglecting the course, her excuse was ""grading"" yet the 4 assignments she graded were 2 short essays and 2 short discussion posts. even with multiple other classes, she should not be this slow, plus this is an english 2 course.

the second time was 16 days, and she only graded 1 assignment when we were without coursework. she has only graded 5 assignments this year, all were submitted in january/february.

she posted the last of the assignments 2 days ago, and i feel as though she cramed multiple units worth of knowledge into 3 ""big assignments"" (as she calls them) with little to no materials to understand the assignments due at all. we have not been taught how to do these assignments, we have not been giving materials to understand the assignments and she does not answer emails. so how are we supposed to do this? 

not to mention, i am scared she may not be able to grade on time. her rate my professor states she has taken months after the course is over to put in final grades &amp; has given a whole class a zero on an essay (i assume bc she wasnt able to grade in time)

i emailed the department chair for a second time, although she is ""out of office without wifi""- although she left another email to contact for ""emergencies."" would this constitute an emergency? or should i just wait in my frustration?

if you choose to skip it, to save the prof some time looking for your exam, you could just give them a heads up you are doing it intentionally. as a prof, i actually appreciate it when students just shoot me a quick note to tell me they intend to fail that component, so then i don't worry about trying to track them down or waste time searching my office/house for an exam or paper that they never turned in.

for example, if the final exam is 40% of the course grade: ""dear prof x. i am not going to take the final exam. i understand that i will get 0% or f on the final exam and that this is 40% of my total grade""

or if there is some line in the syllabus that says you are required to take the final to pass, just explain that you understand: ""dear prof. x. i have chosen not to take the final exam. i understand that i will fail the course.""

this semester is just even worse. professors are not as good (in one very difficult class, professor is just terrible). i don't know what to do. i try my hardest and i study, (and from what i've heard) even more than my peers. yet despite this, things just do not click for me and i am just failing everything. i can't do anything myself, no matter how many times i'm shown how to do it, and how long i try. it all just flies over my head. after absolutely bombing my first cs midterm, i studied longer and harder for the second one, and felt that i understood the practice exams after going to professor office hours. however, after the exam (which was not entirely similar to the 3 mocks we were given), i ended up getting the very same (terrible, as in like mid 30%) grade. i just feel that it broke me. i need at least a 75 on the final to pass the class, and after what happened on my last midterms, i just feel its not possible. after seeing what happened on the last midterm, i just feel so hopeless. i can't even bring myself to study for the final because i've seen how its going to turn out. i know i really should try, but i just think its not possible. this is bleeding into all of my other classes now, too. i feel like i'm not going to pass any of my finals. 

one class (mentioned earlier with the terrible prof) i'm extremely failing but only ""passing"" because of overall grade curve. i don't understand anything that has been going on since my tutor left me because he was too busy.  i feel like i got nothing out of this class either and my exam scores for this class have just been getting cut in half each midterm. i'm definitely going to fail the final. i haven't been able to understand the homework for weeks. i go to office hours often but again, other students are there so i can't hold a ta for a long time. i just want to cry every time i go and they explain something but i can't understand how to do it at all. i feel terrible leeching off my peers, but i truly just do not understand the material, and there is no supplement (e.g. no book the lectures are based off of, its just the bad lectures). 

  
what should i do? is there anything i can do? should i even try my hardest if it means costing a grade for another final? i feel like an idiot.

3926,t3_1ccobw2,1714040107.0,"so for some context, i've been in cc for 4 years now, part of it is because of some housing/mental issues and the other part just generally having a hard time deciding what major to go into.

i don't necessarily enjoyed school, like it lowkey felt like a chore growing up until high school but i also didn't mind it too much? maybe bc i was one of those kids that didn't have to put too much effort into trying to understand something so now that it is harder, i'm not in practice of working hard for school if that makes sense. but i also do like learning about things bc i do find myself in a rabbit hole when looking up things i am interested in knowing. that being said, i don't particularly like any one subject. i don't have a hard passion for anything specific. i hear so many people who are passionate about the science they go to but i don't match that energy. chem is interesting to me, the way chemical react to each other and i enjoy the deeper reasonings as to why certain things happen but i also feel like i picked out of obligation(?). i do like baking and cooking and thought about hospitality and culinary but i know those fields are competitive and don't pay that great unless you are at the top. so that's also why i chose chem. i feel it is similar to baking just more microscopic and i'm pretty good at science and math so this is where i am headed. i could study bio or physics or business or psych but do i want to? no not really, so i picked chem. it seemed like the only subject i have somewhat of an interest in that i was willing to put some effort into.

but because my interest for chem feels superficial to me, i'm still not sure if this the route i should go. i'm starting o-chem this fall and i'm lowkey scared bc i hear so many hard things about it. what if i realize i don't like it anymore? i wouldn't know know what subject to go into. i want to be financially stable in the future too. plus i hear that to do anything good or get a well paying job, most chem majors have to go to graduate school. i'd would be so nice to have the title of phd in my name but what if i can't keep doing school for that long?

i guess what i am asking is, what is it like for current chem majors who are a bit further along in curriculum or about to graduate? did you have a similar experience just pushed through? did you end up liking it more as you learned more?

those who have graduated or pursuing higher ed, how about jobs? are you working in a chem job right now with just a bs/ba? what about school work load? those who stopped at a bachelors, are you comfortable with work? what kind of jobs are you working? i only see toxicology, pharmacology, agriculture as job options online which all require phd. what kind of work does a chem degree offer that isn't requiring a phd or is there truly nothing at all where i have to keep pursuing higher ed? higher education kinda scares me in that i am not going to be able to keep up with those around me, especially if i feel like i only like chem a little bit. like i'm not going to be able to match their passionate energy in the future, maybe feel like a fraud who is only going into chem for stability/financial security.

those who quit, why? what did you end up majoring in and how did you know you wanted to pursue that instead?

ps i am seeking out psychiatric therapy in the summer so maybe i'll change my mind on school but for now, i would say school isn't my forte but at the same time i don't want to just go straight to work or go into trades bc i don't really like any of the trades out there either.

i grew up extremely poor. but not in the “poor so you grew up being aware you have to make money” way, more in the “so poor no one in your family has any financial literacy so you should really do whatever you want because you’ll probably just be poor anyway” way. i was an empathetic child who loved storytelling and decided on a fine arts degree because i had no real understanding of career outcomes. 

now, i’m an adult with several years of work experience under my belt and an entirely different set of values, but i’m feeling very trapped. 

i was a top performer in high school. 5’s on nearly all my ap exams, including up to calculus bc. every teacher i had pretty much begged me to not go into theatre, but i was a kid and had made up my mind. i went to a private university on a full scholarship because of my grades. even though i studied theatre, i was still part of my school’s independent honors college, completed a thesis, and graduated summa cum laude. 

but now, all i have is a bachelor of fine arts degree and regret. 

i want to change my trajectory and go back to school for something i should have studied in the first place but i am finding it incredibly difficult to navigate. once you obtain one bachelors, so many supports drop away. admissions processes seem to be very unclear for second bachelors, and i have no idea how i would pay for a program without financial aid.

i know many people say to skip the second bachelors and go for a masters, but i am looking to study within a stem field and many stem masters (especially computer engineering - a top interest for me) would disqualify a bfa without blinking an eye. 

are there any resources out there that could help guide me through this process? i appreciate any help or advice.

when working with a text book, firstly do not get intimidated with how ginormous some of them are (i believe it's mostely just a money making trick for them). secondly, review the contents section and identify the areas you should start with. thirdly, for the sections you are interested in read the theory but then do the problems. theory must be like 30% of your time and problems like 70%. if you are not doing problems you will never know how truly prepared you are. if you do not understand something, identify the topic and work on it. in my expericnce precalc books are pretty self-contained and you should be able to work on your weak spots using this text book, but if not try searching for like a school algebra text book and use it to work on you weak spot. alternatively, if the particular topic seems real easy just scan through the theory and do like 10-15 problems to make sure you do understand it.

now, regarding the text book, that's the hard part (for me) as i'm not an expert on precalc. the standart recommendations would be precalculus - mathematics for calculus by james stewart and others, or precalculus by michael sullivan. but imo the books are unreasonably bloated and therefore easy to get lost in. maybe try looking for a shorter text book with like a quick theory review and mostely exercises.

there's no information online about how colleges monitor exempted students. any help would be very appreciated, i've been trying to find info for months bc i already committed. i realize in retrospect i should've committed to a school without a housing requirement, but that decision was made prior to things escalating with my family. my home situation isn't on the books at all (only my mother, sibling, and i know i'm my sibling's guardian). i'd be willing to talk to a dean about it but i'd rather take my shot at just lying if i can fully grasp how they surveil/monitor students commuting. i have a potential roommate as well, if having my name on a lease or wtv would be a risk. thanks!",2024-04-25 09:16:16,"['go', 'avoid', 'give', 'specif', 'incom', 'freshman', 'two-year', 'on-campu', 'hous', 'requir', 'would', 'interested_in', 'dorm', 'home', 'life', ""it_'"", 'a_lot', 'explain', 'alreadi', 'move', 'younger', 'sibl', 'live', 'timeshar', 'out-of-st', ""'ll_be"", 'leav', 'younger', 'sibl', 'assum', 'still', 'like', 'four', 'wall', 'hous', 'sibl', 'emancip', 'need', 'respit', 'actual', 'question', 'though', 'live-on-campu', 'requir', 'enforc', 'specif', 'colleg', 'exempt', 'student', 'famili', 'in/around', 'campu', 'famili', 'area', 'would', 'be_abl', 'live', 'rent', 'inform', 'onlin', 'colleg', 'monitor', 'exempt', 'student', 'help', 'would', 'appreci', ""'ve_been"", 'tri', 'find', 'info', 'month', 'alreadi', 'commit', 'realiz', 'retrospect', 'commit', 'school', 'without', 'hous', 'requir', 'decis', 'made', 'prior', 'thing', 'escal', 'famili', 'home', 'situat', 'book', 'mother', 'sibl', 'know', 'sibl', 'guardian', 'will', 'talk', 'dean', 'rather', 'take', 'shot', 'lie', 'fulli', 'grasp', 'surveil/monitor', 'student', 'commut', 'potenti', 'roommat', 'as_wel', 'name', 'leas', 'would', 'risk', 'thank']","[(0, 1), (5, 2), (16, 1), (17, 1), (18, 1), (26, 1), (28, 3), (31, 1), (33, 3), (52, 1), (54, 1), (55, 1), (62, 1), (68, 1), (78, 1), (95, 1), (99, 1), (110, 1), (113, 1), (117, 1), (129, 1), (136, 4), (142, 3), (186, 1), (188, 1), (194, 1), (195, 1), (196, 1), (198, 1), (204, 1), (216, 1), (236, 1), (247, 1), (252, 1), (254, 2), (255, 1), (259, 1), (276, 1), (283, 1), (298, 1), (316, 2), (321, 2), (336, 1), (356, 1), (383, 1), (391, 1), (434, 1), (439, 1), (452, 1), (458, 1), (464, 1), (492, 2), (522, 1), (535, 1), (547, 1), (560, 1), (561, 1), (571, 3), (575, 1), (601, 1), (618, 1), (648, 1), (673, 1), (674, 1), (737, 1), (752, 1), (757, 1), (821, 2), (837, 1), (938, 1), (980, 2)]",[0.01123596 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

3978,t1_l173cpp,1714051251.0,"the 150% rule applies, yes. so for an associate's degree that requires 60 credit hours, your limit is 90 credit hours, regardless of what institution those credits are from (i.e., school-hopping won't get around the rule). the justification is that by that point, you are no longer making satisfactory academic progress (sap) toward your degree. this is actually the whole purpose of the rule -- so students don't ""wing it"" through college without making consistent progress toward their degree and expect financial aid to cover that. this is probably in the financial aid agreement you signed. the only ""reset"" is if you change to a totally different degree type, such as associate's degree to bachelor's degree. (this doesn't actually reset anything, it just raises the limit since the required hours for degree is now higher.)


for some types of aid, the decision can be appealed in extenuating circumstances. in *some* cases, changing your major after several years might count. for example, i had an advisee a few years ago who was a major in a health sciences field at one university and then transferred to biology at my university. because most of their health science courses can't be applied to a biology degree, they ended up with a lot of excess credits and had to submit a sap appeal form with the university's financial aid office each semester to remain eligible for university and state aid (i don't know if this works for federal aid -- ask your financial aid office).

it said that the the losing teams (basically half the class since there’s 4 groups with a jury and the winners being excluded from this) will lose 20 points on the assignment unless we make a 1 page paper describing our beliefs on the topic, if i agree with the jury, and why.

also, i’m kind of in the same boat. i’m doing very well in my other two classes, but i’ve got a c in my precalculus class with two exams between me and the end of the semester. i’m putting everything i’ve got into precalc. but goddamn, it’s objectively one of the hardest classes my college offers, because it covers so much material in just 16 weeks, most of which we’re expected to memorize as none of the exams are open note, and only a handful of formulas are provided to us for exams. 

most of my class is struggling, if not outright failing. and the prof is not the greatest at teaching the material (she can do the math, but her explanations are not always great, and all of her exams, so far, have had pretty significant errors in them). i don’t know how my c is gonna weather the next couple of weeks, but i’m gonna work my ass off to soak in as much information as possible, and hopefully i pull it off.

also - social interaction and building relationships are important life skills that you will definitely need in life, and college is a great time to learn and refine those skills. these are soft skills you can't learn from a book or class - like empathy, conflict resolution, active listening, various forms of communication, assertiveness, reading the room, mirroring, coping skills, arguing, non-verbal communication, boundary setting, etc., and your own style of applying these skills. these are things that come from experience and practice and especially form exposure to a variety of different types of people so you can learn what you do and do not want from others in relationships and how to meet others' needs as well. (books can help guide you, but you have to apply what you read in real life settings). it's not to say you don't get some of this in vr relationships, but it's not the same. plus 80% of communication is non-verbal like body language, body tone, facial expressions, etc., so if you aren't learning how to use and understand non-verbal cues well, you may not be a good communicator in a lot of situations.

not to mention, the connections you make in college often help you later in life at jobs, networking, etc. if you take vr, i'd suggest limiting your time there and focusing on being present for the whole college experience.",2024-04-25 10:03:04,"[""do_n't"", 'know', 'much', ""you_'r"", 'go', 'colleg', 'want', 'expand', 'social', 'circl', 'social', 'life', 'at_least', 'somewhat', 'includ', 'peopl', 'real', 'life', 'like', 'classmat', 'peopl', 'dorm', 'colleg', 'natur', 'a_lot', 'social', 'interact', 'probabl', 'enjoy', 'made', 'friend', 'social', 'activ', 'on_campu', 'rather', 'class', 'back', 'room', 'obvious', ""do_n't"", 'disappear', 'friend', 'mani', 'high', 'school', 'friendship', 'fade', 'colleg', 'anyway', 'peopl', 'stato', 'find', 'their_own', 'life', 'grow', 'differ', 'direct', 'would', 'imagin', 'limit', 'direct', 'grow', 'make', 'effoto', 'maintain', 'contact', 'essenti', ""do_n't"", 'hold', 'onto', 'friendship', 'tight', 'limit', 'abil', 'make', 'friend', 'school', 'also', 'social', 'interact', 'build', 'relationship', 'import', 'life', 'skill', 'definit', 'need', 'life', 'colleg', 'great', 'time', 'learn', 'refin', 'skill', 'soft', 'skill', ""ca_n't"", 'learn', 'book', 'class', 'like', 'empathi', 'conflict', 'resolut', 'activ', 'listen', 'variou', 'form', 'commun', 'assert', 'read', 'room', 'mirror', 'cope', 'skill', 'argu', 'non-verb', 'commun', 'boundari', 'set', 'etc.', 'style', 'appli', 'skill', 'thing', 'come', 'experi', 'practic', 'especi', 'form', 'exposur', 'varieti', 'differ', 'type', 'peopl', 'learn', 'want', 'other', 'relationship', 'meet', 'other', 'need', 'as_wel', 'book', 'help', 'guid', 'appli', 'read', 'real', 'life', 'set', ""it_'"", ""do_n't"", 'relationship', ""it_'"", 'the_sam', 'plu', 'commun', 'non-verb', 'like', 'bodi', 'languag', 'bodi', 'tone', 'facial', 'express', 'etc.', 'learn', 'understand', 'non-verb', 'cue', 'well', 'good', 'commun', 'a_lot', 'situat', 'mention', 'connect', 'make', 'colleg', 'often', 'help', 'later', 'life', 'job', 'network', 'take', 'suggest', 'limit', 'time', 'focus', 'present', 'whole', 'colleg', 'experi']","[(0, 2), (5, 6), (6, 1), (14, 1), (15, 1), (31, 2), (35, 2), (36, 2), (47, 2), (52, 1), (57, 1), (59, 1), (68, 2), (78, 1), (84, 4), (86, 1), (87, 1), (100, 2), (102, 1), (103, 2), (110, 1), (112, 3), (113, 1), (120, 1), (132, 1), (136, 1), (144, 3), (161, 1), (170, 1), (175, 2), (186, 1), (194, 2), (195, 2), (196, 3), (203, 2), (235, 4), (249, 1), (252, 1), (255, 1), (263, 1), (271, 1), (292, 1), (317, 4), (318, 2), (339, 5), (343, 1), (386, 1), (388, 4), (424, 1), (428, 1), (429, 1), (439, 1), (440, 2), (464, 1), (470, 1), (473, 1), (482, 2), (487, 1), (517, 1), (522, 7), (531, 1), (551, 1), (555, 1), (570, 1), (572, 2), (574, 3), (587, 1), (588, 1), (601, 1), (603, 1), (607, 1), (613, 2), (618, 2), (621, 1), (622, 1), (628, 1), (645, 1), (678, 1), (696, 2), (701, 1), (703, 1), (732, 1), (743, 1), (758, 2), (770, 1), (778, 2), (781, 1), (791, 1), (795, 2), (810, 1), (814, 2), (824, 2), (852, 1), (863, 5), (900, 1), (921, 3), (939, 1), (945, 1), (959, 1), (963, 1)]",[0.01212121 0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]

the long answer…

i did awful in high school (barely graduated) and i went to cc when i was older (worked for a couple years, had some health issues, then went). i loved cc and i was in tons of student orgs. got great grades because i wanted to succeed, and i worked hard for that. went into their honors program. 


i got into every school i applied to. every single one. 



prepare for a blob of information…it’s all from other posts i’ve made on how i studied and succeeded in both my cc and my 4 year. 


**when reading**, i’d cover the paragraphs i was t reading so i would only see one paragraph at a time. i also kept the slide next to me and jot down relevant information to those slides. 

**when studying**…


**here is something i put together on another post on** r/college that i got from the disability student services department when i was in college, and from my honors program. 

* **work in 40-45 minute increments.**
   * in my honors classes, they told us that after about 40 minutes, we stop taking in new information and that it was important to stop and do something else (get a drink, take a walk, use the bathroom, etc) and then start a new subject

* **learning good study habits is also important**. (my dss office had me try studying in the following format, which was surprisingly helpful)

   * **week 1:** study slides/readings week 1
   * **week 2:** study slides/readings week 2, review week 1
   * **week 3:** study slides/readings week 3, review weeks 2 &amp; 1
   * **week 4:** study slides/readings week 4, review weeks 3, 2 &amp; 1
   * **etc.**

* **while studying...**
   * **mark in you notes the things that are off for you**
   * **mark things that don’t make sense**
   * **write any questions you have that are prompted from the material (even if you don’t think it’s relevant)**
      * this gives you stuff to ask about in class or in office hours, which demonstrates your drive to know the material and gives the professor a chance to mark down things that might be confusing for the whole class too.
   * **go to office hours and talk to your professors/teaching assistants!** you’d be surprised at how helpful they can be with figuring out how you can better study for your class. this only works if you know where you're struggling at (which you can figure out via the ""while studying"" bullet point above).


**tools**

i used a surface pro and pen, but i know folks who used an ipad and pen. 

there are some great applications for computers and ipads that let you take handwritten notes right on the slides. easy to mark up and highlight. 

i used onenote and it made my life so much easier. i just kept a handful of loose leaf pages for anything in class and everything else when into the onenote notebook. i even would take screenshots of stuff from the textbooks where i was struggling with stuff and mark that up too.

as for your second question about exemptions: every school handles these things differently. if your school advertises an exemption and you feel that you fit those criteria, you should definitely email someone. your school will have some office in charge of housing and dorms. at my school, it was called the “residence hall association”; it’ll probably be something similar. just google your school’s name and “housing office.” a website for your school’s equivalent office will show up. they will have contact information. send them an email like this:

dear [name],

i’m an incoming freshman at [school] and i was hoping to get more information about a possible exemption from the first year on-campus living requirement. what steps would i need to take to get approval to live off-campus as a freshman? please let me know if there is someone else i should reach out to about this.

thanks,

while you wait for a response to that email, reach out to the family you have in the area (call, don’t text) and explain your situation and ask if they’re willing to claim you live with them. if they’re not, see if they’d at least be willing to house the sibling you’re worried about until you’re able to move off campus when the year ends if it comes to that.

wait, let me explain. 

our professor on this subject has specific ways of doing things. she never let us answer on the testpaper, she will give us blank answer sheets. on our midterms exam earlier, unfortunately and for whatever the reason was, i wasn't able to hear her say that the way we should write the number of items should be divided into 3 like, 1-31, 31-40, 41-60. all i heard was the items was 1-60 items. proceed to checking, i actually got good score, which was equivalent to 1.something. 

however, i was genuinely surprised to hear after the class (like dismissal, only few of us were left in the class) that the prof. had instructed us to write the number of items specifically. as you can guess, which just set me into panic mode. istg, i did not hear anything for some reason. my seatmate said that it was also late for her to warned me about it. 

my concern is the probability that she might score me zero for not following instructions, and midterm exams or any major exams is equi. to 40% in our grade. though, i can confidently say i performed well on her quizzes (always scored beyond the passing score) and, got perfect score on her midterm project, also participates and got perfect scores on her oral recitations - these, the quizzes, oral recit and output/projects accounts to 20% each, bringing the total of 60% for class standing. 

do you think, if she ever score me zero, will i still be able to pass with my good performance on her quiz, oral recits, and projects? or if not, can i still save my grade during the finals?

once it's prepared, organizers generally have to go through a series of hoops to get ""final"" approval for a new program.  various academic committees weigh in on things, and then there's the personality aspect - dr. x, whose approval is critical for the proposal to move on, may have an issue with dr. y, who's behind the proposal, and deliberately obstruct or oppose it.  there can be issues with another department which believes that the new program interferes with what they're offering - etc., etc.  even if it makes it to your school's faculty senate for approval, there might be objections that force the organizers to start all over again.  hopefully, this won't be the case in your situation.

first of all it’s group work, which is bad sign number one.

secondly the way it’s graded is horrible, groups consist of three people. so, we dispersed our work three ways and the final guy is supposed to finish it and do his part whenever he can. however, due to all of us taking multiple courses we just do our part then leave it to the next guy. but in the rubric it says must be more then 800 words and 1.5 pages…. now, since we aren’t baby sitters we cannot constantly monitor how the last person did and we only have one submission chance. so usually the last person submits it for the group. 

now here’s where the fucked up part happened… the professor doesn’t grade shit until 3-4 weeks out… which is a problem… considering we have a report every week with once chance. so there’s quite literally no room at all for trial and error, if you fuck up the first one then you’re fucked until the professor gives enough of a fuck to grade it; so you can realize your mistakes. 

we even did an entire report that involved us 3d printing an object for our topology optimization project and got a 0 on the entire report, because last guy didn’t make it 1.5 pages it was 1.3…(oh fucking brother) 

anyway finals are coming next week and the most my group can receive is a 60 not even a fucking d (61 is considered d).

email your partner once per day and cc your professor. persistently try to convince your partner to show. let them know the professor is cced. be careful about what you say and how you say it. imagine your professor's chair or dean and/or some admin reading those messages at some point in the future. explain what you said above, about what your professor is telling you. (you are doing this to establish a paper trail that shows everyone you're trying your best to do things the way that your professor instructed.)

email your professor (once more). in that email, be very polite, professional, clear, and direct: 1) tell them that you followed the instructions. 2) tell them that you will continue trying. 3) state again that you are prepared to deliver the presentation either way. 4) ask again to be evaluated individually should you end up being unable to persuade your partner to participate. 5) follow through. 

if you end up being penalized because your partner did not show, email your professor one more time. again, be very polite, professional, clear, and direct. ask them to reconsider the grade based on all of the above. ask the professor not to hold you accountable for something you have no control over. (you are doing this to establish a paper trail that shows that after receiving an unfair grade, you did your best to resolve the problem at the lowest level.)

throughout all of this, write everything down. maybe send emails to yourself wo you have no doubt later about what happened when. avoid discussing the issue face to face. you want emails. if the professor tells you something in person that pertains to all this, send a polite email.

on wednesday the 17th of april i was in my math lesson and we got given our mock tests back and the support teacher in the classroom was walking around to see what scores we had all got on the test. i was 6 marks off from the highest grade i could get which is a grade 5 i got the highest mark in my class. the support teacher came up to me and said “i thought you would’ve got a lower mark seeing as you don’t talk.” this made me really hate myself and feel really bad about myself and the grade i had received. it has also made me struggle a bit with my mh again. 

i have informed my pastoral tutor at college about a different situation with this support teacher however i have not let her know about this particular situation.

second, i know nothing about law school but always have a plan b. keep your goal in mind but it might take you a bit to get to your dream. you have to get creative and don’t be afraid to lie to you professors to push deadlines.

third, take easy classes…it’s community college. most of the time you might have to retake because they don’t properly transfer (so check with advisors at school you want to go to). 


lastly. i dopped out of 4 institutions (one twice) and still was able to get my dream job without an internship and now making over 100k in my first 3 years in corporate. i know someone that took them 6 years to get into medical school post graduation. a college career is never over, you just have to get crafty. maybe law school does, but college doesn’t teach you what you need to know, it’s there to teach you how to survive and get crafty unless you are in like stem…you just have to do homework.

however, as i've been working here, i've began to notice that this is not what i want to do for the rest of my life. i am currently in undergrad with about 2 years remaining for pa (physician assistant). after undergrad, i will apply to get accepted into pa school and then complete 2 more years to get my pa degree. so roughly 4 years at least. i am at a crossroads in life where i have a stable job that has very good benefits and pay for my age, however i feel that a career in medicine has been something i have always wanted to do and i feel that if i don't try it at my age, i will regret it later on in life. i am wanted to quit my job in order to live at the university to graduate so i don't have to take 2 to 3 classes a semester. everything i have is paid off, the only payments i have are insurance (70 a month), phone bill (50 a month), i don't own a home, and i have ($11,000) in students loans currently (which are currently in freeze since i am currently in school).

also, remember that, in the end, they're looking for an ordinary key, not a stolen file containing the nuclear launch codes, so in the grand scheme of things, this little investigation is pretty trivial.  whoever stops by to ask you questions isn't going to be a master cia interrogator running a diabolical scheme to trip you up.  the person who talks to you just wants to find out what you know and if you observed anything that needs further investigation.

second semester community college commuter student, i live at home with my parents. i just found out my childhood dog has cancer that spread to most of her organs and needs to be put down very soon. she is acting normal now but will likely begin to suffer soon we are trying to wait for 2 more weeks until my father comes home from his overseas military duty, but of course if she starts to suffer sooner we will do it asap. 

finals are coming up and i didn’t study at all today i’ve just been crying and feeling so heartbroken since i found out the news. i’m not sure how to push through this but i know i need to. i’ve worked so hard all semester to get as in all my classes and it would be a shame to lose my as now. i love my dog so much, she has been there for me during every part of my life for the past 10 years and this is really hurting hard.

for concrete problems like sleeping troubles, these personalized meditations work unexpectedly well. although i'm still working on resolving bigger, more complex issues, techniques like 'deconstruct' and 'reframe' in the meditations are game changers by helping me see problems from new perspectives and rewire my emotional responses, making it easier to tackle what keeps me up at night.

it's also ok to not know and just take some basic core classes at community college until he decides.

additionally, i plan to work in a research lab like 3-4 hours a day, 5 days a week. not sure if i'll actually be doing shit for all 4 of those horus so i can probably squeeze in homework and studying into the mix there. 

don't worry i'm not insane (i think) - i only choose to do both orgos because the orgo professor (same one for both) is said to be very easy and i've been told by like so many people that with this guy it's not that bad at all. plus, it's too late in the game to switch this plan and move orgo 2 to the fall as all fall classes are all full. anyway this might be good because my fall workload is really heavy and i don't see myself fairing well taking organic 2 on top of it. 

psychology is said to be easy but just busy work, and the python is literally python (stack overflow will be my best friend). the engineering course will be the hardest one but i must do it over the summer. 

i know for a fact i won't sleep on any of these classes and will make sure to have my shit in as fast as possible (otherwise, because of my program, imma get drop kicked out of my future). fear of failure big motivator here. 

i was just searching this reddit quantitatively about 18 credits and people are taking so many english classes all at once, and others are responding to not do it. i wonder that because i have a wide range here, if i should be okay? or if, the second spring finals end, i should start preparing for total burnout and war?

i have turned in every assignment on time and i took this class because it was synchronous, i work constantly to support myself. 

my professor emailed us on wednesday stating that ""our project is awful and unsuitable"" (we have followed all guidelines and included everything with correct work- which she confirmed and corrected). she stated that we have to all meet with her on either friday before 4pm, saturday, or sunday or else all ten of us will fail. she has also emailed another group saying the same thing.

it is hard for all of us to agree upon a time because we are all working, busy, taking children to school/watching their own kids etc. i am even attending a funeral this weekend and she said there were no exceptions. she has sent multiple emails after saying we will fail.

my question is, is all of this ""ok""? if 9/10 group mates can meet, she has states she will not accept it and we will just fail the class. do i cc the dean? i am not sure how to handle this. i have emailed her and she has just kept saying we will fail. i also tried googling what to do and couldn't find much.

so i am currently a senior fixing to graduate high school. i want to eventually go into college and get a degree is something with sociology or psychology but i am just not sure. i know in my state you have to have a masters for counseling psychology (which is what i have been mainly looking at) but its all just a huge uncertiantly with me. i want to go to college but theres multiple factors in my way. am i going to college for me or because people around me expect me to? the insane amount of debt you can stack up with it. will i actually like my career? oh and the amount of time itll take to get a masters in my degree will be insane. ill be in my mid-to-late 20s by then! i feel so unprepared and no one wants to hear what i want to say or try to help.

i also want to add ive thought of going to community college to see if i want to go into the majors i plan to, but in the end an associates degree wont really help if i dont like it. i also have thought of similar careers that are way shorter but there is little to none, id be a great help if someone could send me some alternatives maybe?

option 1: continuing with teach for america for a teaching credential and master's degree.
option 2: pursuing cal state la's counseling program for school-based counseling and an mft license.
i'm passionate about education and making a positive impact on young lives, which is why teach for america initially appealed to me. however, the prospect of becoming a school counselor and helping students on a more individualized level through the counseling program is also incredibly enticing. the biggest benefit of tfa is that i would have a full time job whereas csula would be longer schooling before i get my main job. my end goal is to be a school counselor but do want experience in teaching and counseling i just don't know what's the better option right after undergrad.

i’m currently doing a bachelor’s degree in science. i had to hand in a systematic review on april 25. i did. however, my gut feeling told me something was wrong. i checked my application and apparently i have been way too hasty. some pages were missing, i think they got lost, because i combined my files into one big file that i uploaded and sent from my tablet. it’s already the next day, and i just sent them the corrected version. they also wanted us to include at least 10 studies, but i couldn’t find more than 4. i’m so scared, i haven’t been eating or sleeping for the past four days. the goal of this course was to learn how reviews are conducted and appraised critically. i really hope that they won’t mind i’ve only been able to find 4 studies. can anyone share their stories with missed deadlines and good endings? i know it’s wishful thinking that this will end well, despite my tardiness, but i need some sleep and to not feel sick to my stomach. thanks ",2024-04-25 20:22:51,"['current', 'bachelor', 'degre', 'scienc', 'hand', 'systemat', 'review', 'april', 'howev', 'feel', 'told_m', 'someth', 'wrong', 'check', 'applic', 'appar', 'hasti', 'page', 'miss', 'think', 'lost', 'combin', 'file', 'file', 'upload', 'sent', 'tablet', 'alreadi', 'next', 'sent', 'correct', 'version', 'also', 'want', 'includ', 'at_least', 'studi', 'find', 'more_than', 'scare', 'eat', 'sleep', 'past', 'four', 'day', 'goal', 'cours', 'learn', 'review', 'conduct', 'apprais', 'critic', 'realli', 'hope', 'won_’', 'mind', '’_ve', 'able_to', 'find', 'studi', 'anyon', 'share', 'stori', 'miss', 'deadlin', 'good', 'end', 'know', 'wish', 'think', 'well', 'despit', 'tardi', 'need', 'sleep', 'feel', 'sick', 'stomach', 'thank']","[(15, 1), (36, 1), (43, 1), (57, 1), (68, 1), (88, 1), (108, 2), (110, 2), (124, 2), (149, 1), (150, 1), (160, 1), (166, 2), (172, 1), (182, 1), (197, 1), (202, 1), (207, 1), (211, 1), (214, 2), (229, 2), (235, 1), (246, 1), (252, 1), (276, 1), (277, 2), (316, 1), (319, 1), (323, 1), (343, 1), (344, 1), (347, 1), (361, 2), (369, 1), (378, 1), (390, 1), (395, 1), (419, 1), (423, 1), (435, 1), (443, 1), (446, 1), (474, 1), (495, 1), (496, 1), (517, 1), (535, 1), (542, 1), (603, 1), (627, 1), (637, 1), (638, 1), (675, 2), (823, 1), (854, 1), (858, 1), (877, 1), (960, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

however, i do strongly encourage you to either double major or at least take as many higher level math courses as you can. math is hard already enough (or at least it takes time) and it is 10 times harder if you don't know what you are getting into. it takes a lot of practice and know how. so don't set yourself up for a perfect shotgun in the foot.

4293,t1_l1a3w0g,1714092058.0,"i’m in my forties and i went (back) to college late, and i’m fine. hell, i’m having the time of my life. i did the party thing when i was in my twenties, never got married, never had kids. i get treated like an elder statesman, where students come to me with questions because i’ve got my shit together and i made the mistakes they don’t want to make. 

a weird thing happens when you get older: you kind of just want to help people. i don’t know if it’s some kind of parental thing that comes up as a matter of age or if it’s just an understanding that the world doesn’t revolve around yourself, but i just want students to be as excited about the material as i am. i tutor a lot of students, and i draw the line at the ones who just want a grade and don’t care about the material. i’ll tutor compsci students who are struggling with dsa all day long, but only if they really want to “get it” on a fundamental level, and i’m not even in compsci anymore; i found another calling. but, i still tutor them because i really enjoy dsa, and i want them to enjoy it, too.

i’ve got a job offer on the table from my current employer. i’ve got one on the table from a former compsci classmate, in case i ever decide to go back to pushing pixels. hiring managers don’t really judge age (because over 35, they legally can’t) because employment is largely transitory today. the days of working for a company for 40 years are gone. today, if you work for a company for ten years, you’ve outlasted most of your bosses. they care if you can do the job.

that said, it’s not a meritocracy. whom you know is more important than what you know. where i work, we are gaming out the scenario where we get a big contract, and that’s going to mean rapid expansion, and every conversation includes the words, “does anybody know someone who can do that?” the devil you know is better than the devil you don’t, and it’s often better to take someone who is 90 percent as good as the best candidate because you know the 90-percenter’s flaws, but you don’t know the 100-percenter’s. and then there’s the sunk cost of going through a hundred or more applications, vetting, hiring, training. why do that when you can hire someone who will hit the ground running?

when i did my last go-round at community college, before ambling off to university, the students who were my age or older had one thing in common: they were hungry; knew what it was to be beaten down and get back up again. one of my lab partners needs a job for the summer, because my program requires major-related work hours in order to take capstone, and i told him i’d ask my boss about an internship, but i put the biggest fucking caveat on that recommendation you’ve ever seen. he’s not hungry; he’s desperate, and those are two very different things. he’s unrepentant (except to professors) about using chatgpt to write papers, which suggests he wants to do the bare minimum; has zero work history; he’s an average intellect on a good day. i don’t want him as an intern. so i picked the freshman who said, “hey, i have to get 400 work hours by senior year,” because that kid is planning ahead. he’s … maybe not hungry, but knows he doesn’t want to be hungry, and that’s just as good.

you’re right about older students being confident in their decisions. there’s an absolute truth in steve jobs’s stanford speech, where he says (hang on, let me grab the quote):

&gt; when i was 17, i read a quote that went something like: “if you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” it made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, i have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “if today were the last day of my life, would i want to do what i am about to do today?” and whenever the answer has been “no” for too many days in a row, i know i need to change something.

he’s right. if i had finished out my compsci degree, i would have eventually thrown my chair through the window and escaped like chief at the end of cuckoo’s nest (spoiler alert for a movie that’s before my time, let alone yours). that’s why i tell students, “don’t declare until you’ve taken the intro class. if you enjoy it *and* you’re good at it, that’s your major. if you fail at one of those conditions, take electives and gen eds. find something else. you don’t want to be in your thirties and dreading every day of work. it doesn’t get better; doesn’t get easier.”

so, if you have older students in your classes, ask them questions. they’ve had life throw things at them, and they’re usually happy to tell you how to recognize an incoming curveball or to duck when a fastball is coming for your head. they recognize the signs of impending doom, and a lot of recruiters would rather have somebody who’s been around the block than someone who’s never left the house. there’s a lot of soft skills they tell you to learn in preparation for the workplace, but experience, in life or in a professional field, is something you don’t get until after you needed

4306,t3_1cd87pc,1714093171.0,"yesterday, i made a trip to my local community college to meet with an academic advisor, marking the first step towards my enrollment. i'm currently in the midst of a gap year and i'm eagerly anticipated beginning my studies in the fall. the advisor informed me that i could start selecting my classes and electives. however, a snag arose when i discovered that i needed to submit my act scores for placement in english and math classes. to my surprise, i was told that my scores had expired, (i didn't even know that was a thing)

the advisor suggested i take placement tests in both math and english. these assessments, somewhat akin to the acts, would take approximately two hours each and necessitated thorough preparation. additionally, i learned that i could opt to take these tests either at the college or from the comfort of my own home, provided i had a computer equipped with a webcam for monitoring purposes.

upon delving into research on these placement tests, i quickly grasped the significant time commitment required for adequate readiness. this realization triggered a surge of stress, reminiscent of my high school days. my gap year was initially intended for delving into the world of coding, a passion i feared might now take a backseat to the demands of test preparation.

consequently, i now find myself grappling with doubts about my readiness to resume full-time student life. the prospect of once again being consumed by academic obligations, mirroring my high school experience, looms large in my mind.

i don't know if resuming my studies is the best idea for me because it'll just bring my my stress, anxiety, and possibly depression, and some of that has already returned when i when i heard about the assessment tests. i'm really not sure on where if even wanna go to college.

my best advice is to make an effort to show up to class every day. most of the concepts build upon what you previously learned and it’s easy to get behind and lost. also do not be afraid to ask for help (tutoring for example) if you feel like you’re getting behind.

normally there’s at least a couple students who are naturals at it in class. if you can, try to become friends with them so they can help you out. become good at excel and use it! very important for some classes because excel can virtually do all the work for you. 

good luck!!!

i managed to get a great scholarship to this school, and it was the cheapest school i applied to (that's why i go here), and i pay 24k a year to go here (before anyone says i should've gone to a state school, they're all the same price as this one, and my state university (the big one) is 32k a year, so yes, it's cheaper) i'm incredibly grateful for my financial aid package (50k a year), because this school is over 70 grand full price... and there's people here who pay that.

i also don't qualify for any subsidized loans due to my family income, and i'm trying to avoid debt, that's why i'm working myself so hard.

4355,t1_l1anh1i,1714099470.0,"i’m 38 and just restarted this semester. i actually had a random redditor diss me because they didn’t have the same view about a completely different topic. they said something like, “hopefully i won’t have to go back to college when i’m 40…” 

i was stunned honestly because it’s 2024 and i’ve only had positive feedback from everyone in my life. i’ll admit, i was a bit nervous to tell my parents because i was afraid they’d think i was making a huge financial mistake, but they were thrilled! 

overall, i think there are still enough mean/rude/crappy people out there who do talk negatively about people starting school late or “starting over,” that many people are afraid of backlash and judgment. but all of that judgment only comes from people who hate their own lives (even subconsciously…) and so it makes them feel better about their own lives. for example, “i know i hate my job and i might’ve even picked the wrong career, but i make bank and at least i’m not that old person having a midlife crisis and going back to school when i’m 30 or 40 or 50…i mean, that has to suck more than my life right now, right? that’s admitting you’ve failed, and i haven’t failed because i have the house, car, and job title to prove it!” 

the person who insulted me also assumed i had failed my first career. it was quite the contrary. i was burned out and killing myself every day after 20 years of the same shite day in and day out. i needed a massive change and i’ve honestly never been happier! 

i’m broke…very broke, (before i decided to go back to school i was spending money carelessly because it was the only way i felt better after work every day. so my savings got depleted pretty fast after quitting and starting school. but i’m so happy. the “being broke” part was what scared me the most, because i was way too attached to money and had been willing to give my life up (literally) for it. not any more. but i had to take that leap of faith to realize it’s not as bad as i remember. it sucks having to choose between medical tests or food…or whether you can afford the gas to visit home to help your parents with a family crisis, but it’s still truly worth it. i just needed to remember that to shake me out of my old pattern and habits. 

turned into a novel here but ultimately, the above reasons are why insecurity exists. because naysayers are too scared to take a leap of faith themselves and push their own fears on others. “i could never go back to school at our age. my brain is fried and i’d fail every test i bet…” (one of the nicer naysayer examples lol) or worse, “are you sure you can afford that? how are you gonna make rent if you only work part time? there’s no way i could ever go back into debt again and eat ramen every day…ugh…that sounds like a nightmare!” 

then when that friend does it anyways, the naysayer changes their tune a bit because it seems “crazy” that anyone could go through with something like that if they can’t. “did you hear john is going back to school? yeah…i dunno…a lot of mid life crisis these days, eh? he could barely keep up with his life before so how is school gonna work? welp…let’s just sit back and enjoy the sh*t show i guess! lol!”",2024-04-25 22:44:30,"['restart', 'semest', 'actual', 'random', 'redditor', 'diss', 'didn_’', 'the_sam', 'view', 'complet', 'differ', 'topic', 'said', 'someth', 'like', 'hope', 'won_’', 'go_back', 'colleg', 'stun', 'honestli', '2024', '’_ve', 'posit', 'feedback', 'everyon', 'life', '’_ll', 'admit', 'nervou', 'tell', 'my_par', 'afraid', 'think', 'make', 'huge', 'financi', 'mistak', 'thrill', 'overal', 'think', 'still', 'enough', 'mean/rude/crappi', 'peopl', 'talk', 'neg', 'peopl', 'start', 'school', 'late', 'start', 'mani', 'peopl', 'afraid', 'backlash', 'judgment', 'judgment', 'come', 'people_who', 'hate', 'their_own', 'live', 'even', 'subconsciously…', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'their_own', 'live', 'exampl', 'know', 'hate', 'might', '’_ve', 'even', 'pick', 'wrong', 'career', 'make', 'bank', 'at_least', 'person', 'midlif', 'crisi', 'go', 'back', 'school', '50…i', 'mean', 'suck', 'more_than', 'life', 'right_now', 'right', 'admit', '’_ve', 'fail', 'fail', 'hous', 'titl', 'prove', 'person', 'insult', 'also', 'assum', 'fail', 'first', 'career', 'quit', 'contrari', 'burn', 'kill', 'everi', 'year', 'the_sam', 'shite', 'need', 'massiv', 'chang', '’_ve', 'honestli', 'never', 'happier', 'broke…veri', 'broke', 'decid', 'go_back', 'school', 'spend', 'money', 'carelessli', 'felt', 'better', 'work', 'everi', 'save', 'deplet', 'pretti', 'fast', 'quit', 'start', 'school', 'happi', 'broke', 'pawa', 'scare', 'attach', 'money', 'will', 'give', 'life', 'liter', 'take', 'leap', 'faith', 'realiz', 'rememb', 'suck', 'choos', 'medic', 'test', 'food…or', 'whether', 'afford', 'visit', 'home', 'help', 'your_par', 'famili', 'crisi', 'still', 'truli', 'worth', 'need', 'rememb', 'shake', 'pattern', 'habit', 'turn', 'novel', 'ultim', 'reason', 'insecur', 'exist', 'naysay', 'scare', 'take', 'leap', 'faith', 'push', 'their_own', 'fear', 'other', 'could', 'never', 'go_back', 'school', 'brain', 'fri', 'fail', 'everi', 'test', 'bet…', 'nicer', 'naysay', 'exampl', 'wors', 'sure', 'afford', 'gon_na', 'make', 'rent', 'work', 'patim', 'could', 'ever', 'go_back', 'debt', 'ramen', 'everi', 'day…ugh…that', 'sounds_lik', 'nightmar', 'friend', 'anyway', 'naysay', 'chang', 'tune', 'seem', 'crazi', 'anyon', 'could', 'someth', 'like', 'hear', 'john', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'yeah…i', 'dunno…a', 'lot_of', 'life', 'crisi', 'day', 'could', 'bare', 'keep', 'life', 'school', 'gon_na', 'work', 'welp…let', 'back', 'enjoy', 'show', 'guess']","[(5, 1), (11, 1), (13, 1), (19, 2), (30, 1), (31, 7), (37, 1), (38, 2), (46, 1), (54, 1), (57, 1), (59, 3), (66, 1), (68, 2), (73, 1), (75, 1), (76, 3), (78, 2), (86, 1), (97, 2), (107, 2), (108, 1), (112, 1), (113, 2), (118, 2), (128, 1), (135, 3), (138, 1), (139, 4), (142, 1), (144, 4), (145, 1), (149, 2), (150, 1), (160, 1), (163, 1), (168, 1), (179, 1), (183, 1), (193, 2), (194, 1), (196, 2), (202, 1), (204, 1), (207, 1), (209, 1), (210, 2), (211, 4), (227, 1), (229, 2), (237, 1), (252, 1), (254, 2), (258, 1), (259, 2), (271, 2), (280, 1), (282, 2), (283, 1), (292, 1), (294, 1), (314, 4), (318, 1), (321, 1), (328, 1), (329, 1), (336, 1), (342, 1), (345, 1), (350, 2), (363, 1), (364, 1), (368, 1), (371, 1), (377, 2), (380, 1), (383, 1), (388, 3), (389, 1), (390, 2), (395, 1), (401, 1), (407, 1), (413, 1), (417, 2), (422, 4), (428, 1), (438, 1), (441, 1), (458, 1), (468, 2), (477, 1), (483, 2), (485, 1), (491, 1), (495, 1), (500, 4), (512, 2), (520, 1), (522, 5), (526, 1), (560, 1), (571, 1), (572, 1), (592, 1), (594, 1), (602, 1), (603, 1), (617, 1), (645, 1), (678, 3), (694, 1), (702, 2), (731, 1), (740, 1), (764, 1), (773, 2), (796, 1), (803, 1), (808, 1), (826, 1), (838, 1), (849, 1), (885, 1), (889, 1), (890, 1), (893, 1), (910, 2), (923, 1), (942, 1), (970, 1), (973, 1)]",[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.]

as far as different careers: if you're interested in working with/helping people, maybe something like a guidance counselor? or human resources? or if it's the science of it then maybe a different stem track?

i don't know your reasons for leaning towards psychology but i think if you can narrow down your motivation then that will help.


and if you decide you don't want to go to college right now then that's okay. it's a really difficult, expensive decision and sometimes going straight into the workforce can help you figure out what you actually like doing.

hi, i’m an international ib student and i’m interested in biology, sustainability, technology and business.

 i have two conditional offers from one from unsw for engineering honours which requires me to get a 33/45 in ibdp and is a 4 year course. for ucl i applied for bioprocessing with b&amp;m which requires me to get a 38/45 in the ibdp which is a 3 year course so if i go here i will apply for a masters in the uk/us after grad. while cwr is an unconditional offer for an undecided major and is a 4 year program. 

i’m not to sure on which to pick, money is not a big problem for me but ideally i would like to a pick a school which will offer me the best job placements and opportunities. 

my end goal is to start and or work for a sustainable tech or biotech company. 

location wise i prefer sydney or london cause they are cities and i love cities but i wouldn’t mind living in ohio for 4 years. i really want to do a masters in the states either ways hopefully at ucb or stanford. 

ik these are very different schools but idk which would be better. ranking wise ucl is the best followed by unsw then cwru. i feel at the end of the day they all provide great opportunities. cwru also has the bonus of not being tied to a major. i do get some sort of flexibility with unsw as i go as an undecided engineering major and specialise in year 2 i think (correct me if i’m wrong). ucl on the other hand the course is super interesting and a very small cohort and is only 3 years but from what i heard some professors are not that great there. i feel like all unis have shitty professors tho so im so confused. i wish i had gotten ucl earlier then i would also have more time to think my decision through but what can we do.

however, when i transferred to a university at 24 (applied and got accepted at 23), the experience has been the total opposite. most of the undergrads went to college straight out of high school. there were some older students, but they were much less common proportionally speaking. i had mixed feelings. on one hand, it felt cool being able to spread my wisdom on things from the early 2000s, but i also felt like the odd one out because a lot of students don’t know about the things i grew up with.
