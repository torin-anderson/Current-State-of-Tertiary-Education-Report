7,t1_kxyqfgk,1712202973.0,"Predicting the curve for the SAT can be quite tricky because it varies from test to test, based on the overall difficulty level of the exam. The College Board designs the curve to ensure that scores are comparable across different test dates, meaning a harder test will have a more generous curve, while an easier test will have a stricter one.

If you've felt that certain sections were particularly challenging, it might indicate a slightly more lenient curve in those areas. However, it's all speculative until the scores are released. As for personal score predictions, it really depends on how well you felt you managed your time, answered the questions, and dealt with the test's difficulty. It's normal to be a bit optimistic about areas you felt strong in and more reserved about the ones that were challenging.

It's also a good time to reflect on the preparation process: the practice tests, the areas you focused on, and how you managed stress and time during the exam. This reflection can be incredibly beneficial, regardless of what your scores turn out to be, especially if you're considering retaking the SAT or preparing for other standardized tests in the future.

Finally, remember that your SAT score is just one aspect of your college application. Colleges consider a wide range of factors, including your high school GPA, extracurricular activities, essays, and letters of recommendation. So, while it's natural to be anxious about scores, try to keep things in perspective.

What about you? How do you feel about the test sections, and what are your own score predictions?",2024-04-03 23:56:13

Have you guys ever heard of a public school bungling this?

This turned out to be a DSAT snafu on the part of college board. There was a new account created for the DSAT test. He was able to get the two accounts merged. within 2 business days.

174,t3_1bwa21t,1712294414.0,"The DSAT is first of all not that bad by itself. I think it does a good enough job as a test. However the post test experience is now Terrible. The fact that the test is no longer standardized throws its reliability out the window. How well does it really tell our ‚Äúcollege readiness‚Äù if we all have different test. If I get all of my weak areas and another guy who didn‚Äôt study gets all his strong areas he gets a higher score just because he got lucky. 

Another thing is the lack of post test review. My first psat was paper. I loved looking over all my questions and seeing what I got right and wrong. Now that is also thrown out the window. All we get is the stupid little bars showing our general knowledge. I have no idea what I should specifically review in math except just ‚ÄúGEOMETRY AND TRIGONOMETRY‚Äù 

I think the digital shift is fine. But it was more than just a platform change. The very foundation of the SAT has completely changed. It‚Äôs kind of dissapointing to say the least.

Edit: I am well aware people got different tests every date. Of course they would as getting the SAME EXACT test multiple times is pointless I agree. However that‚Äôs not the point I‚Äôm making. There is a reason many college professors curve their grade by the score of the highest graded test. If it was hard for everyone then everyone had a fair chance. If some kids got an easy test and some got a hard test then it is no longer fair. Different tests different dates is fine, however EVERY SINGLE TEST being different throws the ‚Äústandard‚Äù out the window. 

The other thing people mentioned is that ‚Äúthe test has a range of topics that remains the same‚Äù disregarding the common changes to it. The variety of difficulty in the 4 math sections for example is insane. To give a real life example, me and all my friends who are currently in Calc AB rigorously prepared for the SAT going over every section in Khan Academy and the digital sat prep book. The final question for some of us was a kite geometry question. We were all stumped, however there were many who didn‚Äôt have it. We all prepared the same way with the same material.

191,t1_ky5gx72,1712313718.0,"A standardized test is a test in which every instance of the test is built to fall in the same statistical range, is built to measure the same skills or knowledge, and reports scores on the same scale, so that, for example, a 1200 on an SAT taken in 2023 in Singapore means the same thing as a 1200 on an SAT taken in 2024 in San Diego. A standardized test is not a test in which everyone gets exactly the same questions -- neither the SAT nor the ACT (nor any other major academic standardized test) ever gave the same questions to all students in every test instance.

The scenario you describe, in which you get questions in your weak areas and someone else gets questions in their strong areas by chance, is not what happens. Every test includes questions testing the same skills and includes those questions in approximately the same proportions. Those proportions are published and available for anyone to see. For example, every student will receive 13-15 algebra questions, 5-7 geometry and trigonometry questions, 12-14 information and ideas questions, etc. The adaptive nature of the test can make one student's second module algebra questions harder than another student's second module algebra questions, but since the difficulty of questions is factored into scoring, that difference is accounted for in the outcomes.",2024-04-05 06:41:58

These links are organized by question type and difficulty and notably DO NOT include any questions that are present on the Bluebook practice tests. That means that you can safely use these PDFs in your studies without worrying about spoiling your practice tests.

You may access the folder at the following link: [https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/8ptxydgpp1fde0l1r01eb/h?rlkey=dknt2mkwhdbroihlacofvnqcv&amp;dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/8ptxydgpp1fde0l1r01eb/h?rlkey=dknt2mkwhdbroihlacofvnqcv&amp;dl=0)

The exact same way it did when students had different tests every month, and students in the same month had one of the multiple different sets of questions used that month.

Are you under the impression that every student on the 40+ Saturday test dates since 2016, plus all School Day, Sunday, make-up, etc. dates had the exact same 154 questions? Looking at the released QAS tests shows that to be not the case.

219,t1_ky69nfd,1712326544.0,"Contrary to the overwhelming consensus in the comment section, I‚Äôm with you. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs standardized at all. Take the vocab questions, per say. I got a bunch of obscure words that no one, probably rarely even scholars, uses regularly. There was no way for me to prepare for these questions other than studying the entire dictionary, which is, frankly, ridiculous. I‚Äôm pretty sure I got these questions wrong and sure enough this was where I lost a bar in my English section. As a disclaimer, I‚Äôm a native speaker who has a wide range of vocabulary and a stronger usage of the language than most of my peers. Had I gotten different words, I might have gotten these questions right and not lost so many points for them.
In addition, I swear that the scoring is messed up. Out of my school, which is a tech school, my home district, and my friend‚Äôs school, which is a math and engineering school (and those kids are SMART), I only know of two people who got above 1500 or above: me with a 1500 and one kid from the math and engineering school who got a 1520. I scored a 1530 in December and the other kid scored a 1560 on the paper so both of our scores dropped despite studying and being strong students. However, the amount of people I knew who scored in the 1300s or 1400s was insane. It seemed very easy to tap into those score ranges, but breaking into the 1500s was almost unheard of, even in my friend‚Äôs school where kids are super smart and specialize in math and STEM and take dozens of AP classes throughout high school and had previously been frequently scoring 1550+. That being said, I feel this test was an unfair assessment of our abilities and is almost as much based on sheer luck as it is preparation and knowledge. I know the college board tried to make it fair but I see many areas where the new testing is inherently flawed. Even if they are making the modules adaptive, I feel that the first module should be the same for everyone as should the harder or easier second module so that it‚Äôs not the luck of the draw for which student gets questions that match their strengths.",2024-04-05 10:15:44

It‚Äôs especially noticeable in Unit 6 of the Kahn Math, it seems that they‚Äôve changed the questions so that you no longer can simply plug everything into desmos, which from what I heard is closer to how the test was on March 9th.

I guess Kahn Academy silently rolled out changes to reflect what the actual DSAT is gonna look like, which kind of sucks for someone who had previously finished the whole Kahn math prep, as now I have to redo the whole thing to see what they changed.",2024-04-06 10:45:49

333,t3_1bxfnwz,1712420910.0,"So, while reviewing the Math Kahn(because post March 9th SAT they silently changed their entire math sat curriculum), which previous to them changing I could easily whiz through. Yet now after reviewing and adapting to their changes I came across a particular problem that to me seems absolutely outrageous.

This is the direct prompt:

‚ÄúAt a particular college, a film club and a chess club were founded at the beginning of the same month. The film club began with 16 members and gained 1 new member per month, and the chess club began with 4 members and gained 4 new members per month. At this rate, at the beginning of which month did the two clubs have the same membership?‚Äù

At first, the problem seems relatively simple, so I first created the equations:

Film Club = 16 + x
Chess Club =  4 + 4x

Then you can either set them equal to solve, or plug into desmos.

Either way, you get that x = 4, and so therefore it should be the 4th month correct?

Wrong, although that‚Äôs how Kahn says your also supposed to solve it, according to them, ‚Äúthe beginning of the 4th month may seem like a tempting answer, but remember where starting at the beginning of the 1st month not the 0th month. Therefore the membership of the clubs would actually be the same at 1 + 4 = 5, so 5th month.‚Äù

Now the Kahn academy is explanation is literal garbage. Because the prompt only ever mentions ‚Äúsame month‚Äù and ‚Äúbeginning of month‚Äù at no point does the prompt reference the first month at all.

In reality, the actual logical explanation as to why it is the 5th month is because it says ‚Äúat the beginning of which month would they be the same‚Äù - and because they each gain members over the course of each month, it would mean that the fourth month would have had to have passed to reach the full membership value we calculated. Nothing in regards to ‚Äú1st month‚Äù. 

Sorry if this is just rambling, it just seems so silly. My test anxiety for my SAT this month is already sky high, especially considering the fact that everyone from March 9th who was getting near perfects on all the practices absolutely bombed, and considering that I also have been getting near perfects on the practices. I‚Äôm absolutely terrified of the fact that despite all my effort, I‚Äôm still gonna bomb.

Either way, for us April testers, let‚Äôs keep our chins up, at least we know about the college boards evil trick beforehand, unlike our unfortunate March comrades.

Best of luck everyone, tips are greatly appreciated!",2024-04-06 12:28:30

thing is, my english score was the highest at like a 740, and my math a 680, mind you, im taking ap calc ab, and i taught myself linear algebra and geometric algebra for graphics programming, i also enjoy math and spend hours going through different proves and derivations.

when i saw the breakdown, it was like 2 bars off of geometry, full bars for all the others, which was the thing i didnt study for at all and lowkey kinda forgot, its frustrating because if i took like 2 days to study for that, im confident i couldve done that 100% correct. im sure i got some other things wrong, like some quadratic formula stuff that i forgot, still things that i coulve done easily had i studied for it.

i really like to logic through things and derive stuff, which is alright for school, and i can get by while memorizing very little, but on the sat where its timed? hell no, and i ended up finishing the test with 3 questions unanswered because of it.

im saying all this because i wanna tell you that you shouldnt beat yourself up over it, sometimes you just missed something you forgot to study for, and it has no bearing on your intelligence, a simple mistake in preparation.

If you want to be competitive for scholarships it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to try again after some studying. She can also try the ACT and see how she does on that, but this is what I‚Äôve seen work for the SAT:

If she‚Äôs struggling with math, I‚Äôd recommend 1600.io. It‚Äôs a giant digital textbook that covers everything on the math portion of the SAT (skip the part on imaginary numbers; that‚Äôs only on the old SAT). It comes with video explanations for almost every problem and explains everything in great detail. If she has a lot of gaps in her math knowledge she can read the whole thing; she can also just look at the sections that she‚Äôs missing (ex: if she doesn‚Äôt know a lot about circles, she can look at the chapter on circles). It‚Äôs $20 for a month worth of access and I found it very helpful. After a month of using it she can use Khan Academy (free) to practice what 1600.io taught her.

I‚Äôm pretty good at English so I don‚Äôt have a ton of advice here, but Erica Meltzer‚Äôs [SAT reading book](https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Reader-Fifth-Complete-Reading/dp/B0BT9PB5DS) and [SAT grammar book](https://www.amazon.com/Sixth-Ultimate-Guide-SAT%C2%AE-Grammar/dp/1733589597) are very highly recommended here. Make sure you get the versions for the digital SAT (I‚Äôve attached the links so you know which ones they are; the names and editions can be kind of confusing). One thing I did find useful is to practice reading different kinds of passages; the SAT has a wide variety of content, like scientific passages, prose, biographical stuff, etc. So getting used to reading different works, finding the main idea, understanding the author‚Äôs claim, searching up unfamiliar vocabulary, etc. is useful. I‚Äôve always been an avid reader and that helped me a lot with the English section.

Note that I‚Äôm not affiliated with anything I recommended here; this is all either stuff that worked for me or that I‚Äôve seen work for a lot of people. Personally I don‚Äôt see the point of a tutor unless she‚Äôs really behind, but I don‚Äôt think she is if she‚Äôs scoring a 1370 already. Hope this helps! :)",2024-04-07 12:24:52

Prohibited features:
-A second laptop, other computer or tablet, applications outside of Bluebook, mobile phones, smartwatches, or wearable technology

-Models that can access the internet, have wireless, Bluetooth, cellular, audio/video recording and playing, camera, or any other smartphone-type features

-Models that have a computer-style (QWERTY) keypad, pen input, or stylus

-Models that use electrical outlets, make noise, or have a paper tape


The fx-991EX doesn't have any of those features. Is the fx-991EX allowed? And if it somehow isn't, what is the best allowed calculator i can get?

637,t3_1bzk9c6,1712640084.0,"The median SAT score is between 1020-1050 depending on the source you look at. The people on this sub say you need a 1450+ or 1500+ to be competitive for a good school. You really don't need an sat score that high. For most 'good' colleges, something as low as 1200 is considered competitive.


 And SAT scores are only a small component of college admission. Most schools value GPA and extracurriculars way more than standardized tests. But the general rule of thumb is to go test optional if you score below the 25th percentile for that school. In some states, public universities are no longer even allowed to take into account SAT scores for admissions, just for scholarships.

While good scores can be a helpful asset, it's not the 'end all-be all' for students anymore. So try and calm down and not stress too much about getting an amazing score. Being stressed only makes test day even harder. Just do your best, and it'll be okay!

However the book in comparison to the rest of the math portion of test is slightly harder imo. But because the book is somewhat harder than most of the SAT math questions (keep in mind how I only said most because some of those M2 questions are diabolical), means that studying it is a good choice because if you can solve those problems which are slightly harder then it puts you in a good position for the actual test.

My additional advice is most definitely to go through the entirety of the Math Kahn Academy SAT prep, because it is quite literally the closest to the DSAT, particularly the last few units as those are close to the reality of the harder questions. The reason I recommend Kahn is because not only is it officially supported by CollegeBoard, but they silently rolled out changes to the sat prep courses on Kahn Academy after the March 9th test, making it more reflective of the actual difficulty.

And the real test is not question-wise adaptive. You have a unique, but pre-selected set of questions for the first module. They don‚Äôt change based on your performance.

831,t3_1c105tu,1712792137.0,"Just finished the SAT after preparing for quite a while, and I'm literally fuming. This kid who sat next to me chewed gum like he was the reincarnation of a cow. I had to stick my thumbs in my ears to drown out the noise so I could focus. It was so loud in an otherwise quiet classroom, like, I was not aware someone could chew that loudly. After the first module I raised my hand and asked my proctor if he could have the kid spit out his gum, but he said it would have to wait until the break. Thing is, the proctor didn't even talk to the kid. I ended up having to do it myself. Luckily he spat it out after being asked. 
Yeah yeah whatever, I wouldn't be that mad, but I just wish the proctor wouldn't have like completely blown me off. I just can't understand why the proctor couldn't just pick up the trashcan that was right by his desk and take it to the kid for him to quickly spit out his gum. (The kid was one of the closest to the proctors desk)
I even felt bad after I asked him to spit it out because what if it was a memorization technique, but I overheard the kid talking to his friend about how he just ""clicked through the answers as fast as I could"" . Pretty sure he spent more time doodling on his scratch paper than on the test. 
Anyway, thanks for letting me rant.

Coffee is known to have laxative effects on the uninitiated.  
Caffeine dehydrates and I've seen kids get the shakes during the test.  

Stick with whatever enemy you KNOW you can tolerate.  I also suggest eating something light as a snack before and something with protein and sugar for the break time.  Sugar is a quick boost, protein holds you through.  (I say despite the health issues normally- Snickers aren't the worst option  quick and meets the need, but a boost protein and a cheese stick/slim Jim is helpful too.)

852,t3_1c14ooa,1712804998.0,I know im late to the party but march was a packed time for me and I didn't really care about my score until now when I checked score details. I got a 1330 in the November SAT and a 1390 in March. But I felt the test was so much more different in the math section than the practice tests. Random weight of table and variable questions threw me off because I got so used to the rhythm and pattern of the practice tests. I really felt I worked hard and by the end of my practice I was scoring a 1570. I even had to travel to Sacramento(I live in south bay) to take my test. Sorry for the rant. I know that there are no excuses and the score I got was the score I earned but what do I do now?

But yeah, the first time I took the paper SAT, a guy started chewing gum on the first break and continued it for the rest of the test (we even had that surprise fifth section and he was still going, like what are you even chewing on at that point). I retook it 2 months later and jumped 80 points from nothing (took it a third time btw, I would not be complaining about a 1500 like this).

But the proctor blowing you off like that was ridiculous.

I need to know this information in order to make the questions and question-selection algorithms for Mathchops (link removed at request of mods). So I tagged every question a bunch of different ways. Then one of my partners helped me make a Python script and we did a ton of data analysis.

1. **Y-intercept** ‚Äì Usually either asking you to plug in 0 for x or figure it out based on the wordy description.
2. **Slope** ‚Äì Use the slope formula. Go back and forth from equation to graph. Find the equation when given two points. Find the slope based on a word problem.
3. **System of equations** ‚Äì Substitution, elimination, multiply then eliminate.
4. **Plug in** ‚Äì You have a value or a point that needs to be plugged into an equation or function.
5. **Exponential growth** ‚Äì Be comfortable with this: Final = Initial(1+/- rate)\^time. Sometimes there are fractional exponents.
6. **Algebra translation** ‚Äì Convert a word problem into an equation.
7. **Percent** ‚Äì All variations: basic, increase/decrease, markup, discount.
8. **ax + by = c** ‚Äì Be comfortable finding intercepts and the slope.
9. **Plug in zero for intercept** ‚Äì If 3x + 4y = 24, what is the y-intercept? Equations and word problems.
10. **Factoring** ‚Äì The basics, plus zero product property, difference of two squares, perfect square trinomials, factor by grouping, u-substitution.
11. **Combine like terms** ‚Äì Frequently included in other question types.
12. **Translations** ‚Äì Mostly parabolas, sometimes cubic functions and circle equations.
13. **Substitution (systems)** ‚Äì If y = 3x + 2 and 3x + 4y = 10, what is the value of x?
14. **Meaning of a constant** ‚Äì Usually a slope or y-intercept in a word problem.
15. **Plug in point** ‚Äì If (4, 6) is a point on the line 3x + 5y = k, what is the value of k?
16. **Find the rate (exponential growth)** ‚Äì When given an exponential growth equation, identify the rate (or vice versa).
17. **Answer is not x** ‚Äì You might solve for x but then be asked, ""What is 2x - 3?""
18. **Pythagorean Theorem** ‚Äì Usually part of something else, like SOHCAHTOA.
19. **Similar triangles** ‚Äì Set up a proportion based on similar triangles. They have proof-like questions as well.
20. **Rectangle area** ‚Äì Basic or part of an algebraic word problem, sometimes quadratic.
21. **-b/2a** ‚Äì Use this to find the x-coordinate of the vertex.
22. **Discriminant** ‚Äì Use b\^2 - 4ac to solve for the number of solutions in a quadratic equation.
23. **Average** ‚Äì Arithmetic mean. Mostly basic but a few advanced ones, like the average sum trick.
24. **Given output, find input** ‚Äì If f(x) = 3x + 20 and f(m) = 41, what is the value of m?
25. **Exponential y-intercept** ‚Äì You could be given a graph or an equation. Remember that anything to the power of 0 is 1.
26. **Pythagorean Triple** ‚Äì As in 3:4:5 or 5:12:13. Usually combined with SOHCAHTOA.
27. **Distribute negative** ‚Äì A common trap in equations.
28. **Isolate variable** ‚Äì These usually require several algebraic moves (+/- from both sides, factor something out).
29. **Ratio** ‚Äì Part:part, part:whole.
30. **Quadratic and linear system** ‚Äì In the past, you‚Äôd generally need to substitute, factor, and solve. Now, you can use Desmos for a lot of these.
31. **Factor out constant** ‚Äì As in converting 3x + 6 into 3(x+2). Usually part of the factoring process.
32. **Absolute value equations** ‚Äì Know that there are always two solutions to an absolute value equation. For example, if |2x - 3| = 7, then 2x - 3 could equal 7 or -7.
33. **Solution is intersection** ‚Äì Know that the point where two lines intersect is the solution to a system of their equations.
34. **Match constants** ‚Äì If 3x + 4y = ax + by, what is a + b?
35. **System of equations, no solution** ‚Äì Know that the lines have to have the same slope.
36. **Angle chasing** ‚Äì 180 in a line, 180 in a triangle, corresponding angles, vertical angles.
37. **Rectangular prism** ‚Äì Volume and surface area.
38. **Conversion** ‚Äì Watch out for ones that involve powers. For example, they might give you the conversion for yards to miles, but then ask about square miles.
39. **Linear inequalities** ‚Äì You might be asked to solve one inequality or deal with a system.
40. **Range** ‚Äì Highest minus lowest in a group of numbers.
41. **Fractions** ‚Äì Usually a part of something else. You would not be directly tested on something like 3/4 + 5/7.
42. **SOHCAHTOA** ‚Äì Set up the basic ratios. Know that similar triangles have the same trig ratios. Sometimes combined with the Pythagorean Theorem.
43. **Probability** ‚Äì Usually a basic part/whole question. But sometimes you have to know that probabilities add to 1, or be careful to note exactly what the numerator and denominator should be: ‚ÄúGiven that the student was a junior, what is the probability‚Ä¶‚Äù
44. **Identify function** ‚Äì Usually linear or exponential, but sometimes 1/x or sqrt(x).
45. **Value/frequency charts** ‚Äì They‚Äôll tell you the value and frequency and then ask about mean or median.
46. **Median** ‚Äì Can be presented lots of ways: word problem, table, box and whisker plot, value/frequency histogram.
47. **Circle equation** ‚Äì Know horizontal and vertical shifts, how to find the radius. You sometimes need to complete the square.
48. **Factor by grouping** ‚Äì Used in equations like these: 3x\^3 + 3x\^2 +7x + 7.
49. **Cubic equations** ‚Äì To be safe, know the general characteristics of the graph and be able to apply common equation-solving techniques.
50. **Exponents** ‚Äì All basic operations.
51. **Fractional exponent** ‚Äì Rewrite radicals as fractional exponents and vice versa.
52. **Radicals** ‚Äì Arithmetic operation, translate to fractional power, solve as part of an equation.
53. **Elimination (systems)** ‚Äì If 2x + y = 10 and 2x - 3y = 2, what is the value of y?
54. **Line of best fit** ‚Äì These are usually just slope questions. Sometimes they ask about specific points.
55. **Complete the square** ‚Äì Useful for circle equations, as an alternative to the quadratic formula, and for putting quadratic equations in vertex form.
56. **Margin of error** ‚Äì They might ask for a ‚Äúplausible value‚Äù based on the sample size, total population, and margin of error.
57. **Multiply, then eliminate** ‚Äì In a system, multiply one equation by something so that you can add or subtract to eliminate a variable.
58. **Area of a triangle** ‚Äì Sometimes just the basic formula, sometimes part of a harder question.
59. **Radians** ‚Äì Be comfortable switching between degrees and radians.
60. **Special right triangles** ‚Äì Know 30:60:90 and 45:45:90 triangles. Usually employed in harder questions.",2024-04-11 09:45:26

That being said, I do have a personal theory about May being easier. May 4th is right before AP exam season, so many people doing APs (at least the ones I know) try avoid taking the may sat so they don‚Äôt have to stress about APs and SAT at the same time. These people also tend to be stronger students academically since APs are somewhat challenging. Thus, your competitors for the may sat might be slightly weaker which might make the curve more lenient. However, I doubt this is a significant difference",2024-04-12 02:13:15

1014,t3_1c25sgg,1712917867.0,"Hello. I'm from India, currently in 12th standard. A few months ago I got into researching basic stuff about foreign colleges, and I heard from someone that SAT is an exam which people in the US give for top tier colleges there. I'm not sure how much of this information is valid and how much isn't, so please correct me if I am wrong.

I had a few questions regarding SATs, which might be stupid, but would help me decide whether I will give this exam or not. I know I can find many of these on Google but I would love to hear what others have to add on to it as well:

1. How much is the fee to give the exam if I am a foreign student?
2. What is a ""good"" score in SAT to get into a top university in the US (or other countries, if they accept SAT results too)
3. What score could guarantee a good scholarship in those top universities?
4. My math is my strong part so I know I won't face difficulties in that, but my English isn't top notch. I don't know what level of English is required for SAT, so what could be some sources to evolve my vocabulary in that direction?
5. What is the age limit for the exam? Does it only offer undergraduate courses? As in, can SAT be given for a postgraduate course as well?
6. How many marks correspond to which branch of study? As in, can I get computer science with a 1550 score but not 1450? (The scores are just examples) Or is your branch of interest your own choice and you just have to give the exam for getting access to join the college? (Please excuse my lack of knowledge over this subject)
7. Is there anything else I should know?

Please do provide any extra information for any of these, if you could. I am a bit behind on knowledge about all this and would love to know more. Thank you so much for reading this and considering to help üòÅ",2024-04-12 06:31:07

1023,t3_1c28iyv,1712926776.0,"# RESULTS (Descriptive Stats)

*This is the combined for three different tests: US Students March, International Students March, Spring School Day.*

|Category|All March Students|US Students March|Internationals March|Spring School Day|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Average Reading Score|705.3|709.1|695.9|705.1|
|Average Math Score|710.8|703.2|729.6|695.1|
|Observations|372|266|107|37|
|Score range Reading|380-800|440-800|380-800|590-800|
|Quartiles Reading|670-750|680-750|660-740|670-760|
|Score Range Math|430-800|430-800|580-800|530-800|
|Quartiles Math|680-760|670-750|690-780|660-740|
|Difficulty Rating English (1-5)|.|3.172|3.673|3.162|
|Difficulty Rating Math (1-5)|.|4.468 (!)|3.757|3.946|

**Interesting things**: 1) r/SAT's average scores are crazy high. An ""average"" r/SAT March test taker's score would be the 97th percentile among all US students (94th percentile among test takers) in Reading and 96th percentile among all US students (92nd percentile among all test takers) in Math.

2) The US Math section was maybe the hardest math section ever. Fellow mod u/Donald_Keyman has kept difficulty ratings of the [various sections for years](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/1311v9l/april_2023_sat_difficulty_ratings/), and only 3 out of 148 sections were rated above 4 on a 1-5 scale, and those were all reading sections from 2019-2020. This is the hardest rated section we've seen since we've been doing this. The previous highest rating was 4.184. Wowza. This really does seem like a rough one.

# RESULTS (Correlations)

I ran correlations between people's official scores and practice test scores (almost no one had the chance to do Practice Tests 5 or 6 before these test dates). I won't explain what correlations are in detail (see [Khan Academy's explanation](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/describing-relationships-quantitative-data/scatterplots-and-correlation/a/correlation-coefficient-review)). In short, a correlation of 0 would mean there is no relationship between the two results (complete randomness) and a correlation of 1 would mean that you could perfectly predict one result from the other. Generally, correlations above 0.7 are considered ""highly correlated"", and correlations between .4 and .699 are considered ""moderately correlated"". In our case, the higher the correlation between the official score and a practice test, the more accurately that practice test is predicts the official score. Correlations are signified with ""r"" in statistics. Highest correlation from each test is **bolded**.

**ENGLISH****:**

|Category|All March Students|US Students March|Internationals March|Spring School Day|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|r of Official English and Official Math|0.499|0.527|0.539|0.605|
|Observations for above, n=|372|266|107|37|
|r of Official and Bluebook 1 English|0.630|0.667|0.554|0.743|
|n=|235|161|74|19|
|r of Official and Bluebook 2 English|0.674|**0.698**|0.620|0.738|
|n=|195|132|63|15|
|r of Official and Bluebook 3 English|**0.718**|0.697|**0.748**|**0.924**|
|n=|160|103|57|11|
|r of Real and Bluebook 4 English|0.607|0.506|0.693|0.867|
|n=|145|88|57|9|

**Conclusion**: Bluebook 3 is probably the best predictor for English. 

I also ran correlations between students' official English and Math scores for fun. Interestingly, if you pool the two March groups (U.S. and International), the correlations become worse because they have different distributions ‚Äî US students had on average similar English and Math scores, but International students had on average a \~35 higher Math score. Just shows how different the test is for achieving US and International students. 

**MATH:**

|Category|All March Students|US Students March|Internationals March|Spring School Day|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|r of Real and Bluebook 1 Math|**0.647**|**0.730**|0.440|0.660|
|n=|233|160|73|18|
|r of Real Bluebook 2 Math|0.605|0.671|0.436|0.451|
|n=|194|132|62|14|
|r of Real and Bluebook 3 Math|0.602|0.636|0.526|**0.727**|
|n=|158|102|56|12|
|r of Real and Bluebook 4 Math|0.604|0.620|**0.577**|0.473|
|n=|140|85|55|9|

**Conclusion:** Who knows? Before this, a lot of people seemed to assume that Bluebook Math 4 was the best predictor. It doesn't look that way. All of the different official tests (March US, March International, School Day) had their highest correlations with different practice tests. I don't know what to make of that. With International March students, there's any interesting thing where each test is more highly correlated with a later test, suggesting perhaps that practice helps, but you see the opposite for US March students, suggesting perhaps that practice just made things worse, lol. I don't know what to make of that, either.

# Are you planning on taking the SAT again?

I just thought it was interesting that the students not taking it again had slightly lower average English and total scores than the unfortunate souls taking it again.

Step 1: Only pray for the best and try as hard as you can to keep yourself comfortable and anxiety-free. Step 2 (optional): Listen to some subliminals to strengthen your subconscious mind; this will make you feel much more confident. Step 3: Revise all the essential stuff in the first 2 weeks and do a few exercises on the concepts that you don't have a good grasp of (based on your performance on the mock tests). Step 4: For the last two weeks, cram real hard by doing all the available sectional tests (7‚Äì10 questions each), see what you got wrong, and analyze why you made those particular mistakes. Keep practicing until you make fewer mistakes on the specific fractions that you usually get wrong at. The day before the test, review the most important concepts that make up the majority of your score. Last but not least, sleep well, eat well, remember not to stay up late in the night, and avoid envisioning the negative what-ifs. Good luck!",2024-04-13 13:01:52

2. Keep prompting it to be more extensive until you are satisfied (I did for 119 prefixes, 32 suffixes)
3. Ask it to create a pastable version of the list for Google Docs that includes the prefix/suffix and their definition
4. Go to Quizlet and go to its Magic Notes feature
5. Upload the Google Doc with your list of prefixes/suffixes
6. Go to your study sets tab and it will be there. (For me, it said it couldn't generate flashcards and just grouped the prefixes/suffixes by definition, but when I checked my study sets, the flashcards were there.)

1244,t3_1c3kitm,1713067372.0,"So I've been doing alright on the practice tests on bluebook, I feel I've been making some modest progress touching up on a few subjects, and my practice test grades have been steadily increasing. The issue is that my test is on Tuesday, and I haven't been improving enough to reach my goal(1500+) from my current test grades(1400-1450). Somehow I neglected to actually study for the day before yesterday, and my lack of foresight is really biting me in the butt now. 

Just to give some backstory, my ELA scores have always been between 740-750 with one at 700, while my math scores vary, but are generally around 700. The biggest issue for me is that I can't see how I'd prep for ELA, as there isn't one type of question I get wrong, I just occasionally mess up. With math, it's different as I'm usually lacking higher level quadratic skills and advanced algebra skills in general. 

I was feeling pretty good with my progress, and then got destroyed by the practice test 4 math module 2 section, so morale is pretty low right now. This is compounded by the fact that I can't seem to get above 750 in the ELA section, and it really does seem random as to whether I get a question right or wrong, so I'm at a point where I feel studying ELA is pointless, but I need to improve anyhow to reach 800. I also need to improve on my math skills, but no matter how many times I review the Khan academy recommended section on a certain topic, I always seem bound to get it wrong as it's in a different format on the next test.

This all leads to the question: what can I do to improve these skills in a timely fashion? I really shot myself in the foot giving myself only a few days to review 3 years of math content, but I'm now realizing I'll even have issues with the ELA section on occasion, despite the fact that I'd like to rely on it to average out the overall score. So... any suggestions? Recommendations? Strategies for what I could do to make this situation work?",2024-04-14 00:02:52

1248,t3_1c3m1wz,1713072949.0,"So in October of 2023, I decided I was going to study for the SAT paper version instead preparing for the digital version, so I began studying a lot for it. I took the November SAT as preparation and scored a 1470 (690 RW, 780 M), so I aimed my preparation mainly towards reading/writing. Then in December on the last ever paper SAT, I scored a 1500 (770 RW, 730 M). So, as of now, my superscore is a 1550 (770 RW, 780 M). I know extra-curriculars and school-academics play a significant role in acceptance, but just assume my other aspects are good enough. So based on all of that context, I was wondering if you guys had any advice for a few questions I had.  


1. I heard Stanford and other top IVY schools require you to score in the top 1% of SAT/ACT takers in order to have a score of 1 for academics, so do my scores qualify for that?
2. I know I can eventually get a 800 on the math section, but I've always struggled in reading/writing. So is it worth it to study for and take the DSAT and try to get a 800 on math and bomb the reading/writing for a higher superscore?
3. Are my scores relatively competitive enough for top IVY schools? (Not trying to sound obnoxious if you think my scores are high, but a lot of people I know scored 1580+ and didn't get in to those schools)
4. Should I submit my 1550 superscore or my 1500 straight score and is there a huge difference in how the college admission officers look at a 1550 superscore vs a straight 1550?

1295,t3_1c3z65t,1713116288.0,"So in October of 2023, I decided I was going to study for the SAT paper version instead preparing for the digital version, so I began studying a lot for it. I took the November SAT as preparation and scored a 1470 (690 RW, 780 M), so I aimed my preparation mainly towards reading/writing. Then in December on the last ever paper SAT, I scored a 1500 (770 RW, 730 M). So, as of now, my superscore is a 1550 (770 RW, 780 M). I know extra-curriculars and school-academics play a significant role in acceptance, but just assume my other aspects are good enough. So based on all of that context, I was wondering if you guys had any advice for a few questions I had.

1. I heard Stanford and other top IVY schools require you to score in the top 1% of SAT/ACT takers in order to have a score of 1 for academics, so do my scores qualify for that?
2. I know I can eventually get a 800 on the math section, but I've always struggled in reading/writing. So is it worth it to study for and take the DSAT and try to get a 800 on math and bomb the reading/writing for a higher superscore?
3. Are my scores relatively competitive enough for top IVY schools? (Not trying to sound obnoxious if you think my scores are high, but a lot of people I know scored 1580+ and didn't get in to those schools)
4. Should I submit my 1550 superscore or my 1500 straight score and is there a huge difference in how the college admission officers look at a 1550 superscore vs a straight 1550?

1361,t1_kzmjg9z,1713149168.0,"Idk if u need advice form anybody at all, but eh, here goes nothing :

#OVERALL
1. Start with math first, it‚Äôs better to inflate your grade to an 700+ on math than inflate it later.
2. Take a practice test(5 or 6, not the rest, they‚Äôre just rushed; they‚Äôre not too close to the real SAT compared to others )
3. As everyone says ‚ÄúGo over your mistakes‚Äù, that‚Äôs what you should also do too.
4.Now, go see what you‚Äôve got wrong.

#MATH AND ENGLISH
1. Now write down the topics you got wrong on the sections( idc if you know em, still note em).
2. Now, my boy, khan academy will be a savior. Head over to Khan Academy and start with the foundations, slowly build your way up to advanced. After mastering all of the weakened topics, and getting crowns on them, take another practice test.
3. Now repeat the cycle until you‚Äôve finished khan academy (95% course complete or higher).
4. If you bored of khan, go to the SAT question bank and do the same. When you at the queeiom bank, choose SAT and with whatever (math or English), choose every topic and then filter ‚Äòem out based on your weaknesses and difficulty (I recommend hard if you can get above 1250)

#TIPS:
1. Don‚Äôt stop studying the SAT for too long, it‚Äôs a spoiled baby, it gonna keep crying and making your situation the worse the less you care for it
2. If you lose motivation to study, think about the future when you can finally stop studying for anything.
3. Make sure you‚Äôre actually learning the material rather than memorizing it.
4. For English Vocab, go to Merriem Webster or a similar website and study vocab 
5. On math, if u unsure about how to do percentages, USE DESMOS. You‚Äôre able to replace values with whatever number ANY time. It‚Äôs the best gift ever",2024-04-14 22:46:08

1390,t1_kzo6arl,1713185203.0,"YES math is very easy to improve. What helped me was watching a youtube video of someone solving practice tests. i would pause the video before they began solving, and try my absolute hardest to solve it on my own as if i was actually taking the exam. if i really didn‚Äôt know it or where to start i would think about WHY i don‚Äôt know it and WHAT i needed to learn to be able to improve this. A lot of the SAT is baseline algebra, trigonometry, geometry, etc. So you really have to make sure you know how to do those things ALONG WITH trying to solve the weirdly twisted sat questions that try to confuse you. I promise you, once you start solving these questions and you figure them out and go ‚ÄúOHHHH so that‚Äôs what they want you to doooo!!‚Äù lmao you‚Äôll have a much easier (and faster) time recognizing what you need to do and how to do it. The questions i‚Äôm thinking of right now are the ones with multiple constants. Once you learn how to do those the rest will come easy because you know the specific method they want you to use. I recommend using the sat question bank from college board (just look that up) if you haven‚Äôt already heard of it. (you can mess around with the settings) but start with the easy questions to see where you‚Äôre at, maybe do 10 questions and try not to get any wrong. Then do the same increasing the difficulty til you‚Äôre more comfortable with the harder questions. I don‚Äôt know how much time you have but i recommend doing these practice questions daily. There‚Äôs thousands so don‚Äôt worry about running out, just try to get thru most of them. And your reading score is also improvable. Just do the same thing for reading with the practice questions from the cb question bank. And if you don‚Äôt know something or you‚Äôre unsure about it, (for example i realized i didn‚Äôt actually understand grammar rules and was just going off of what ‚Äúsounded right‚Äù which won‚Äôt always work because the SAT is sneaky) ITS OKAY TO NOT KNOW. It‚Äôs more important that you don‚Äôt know and put in the work to learn and relearn till you see an improvement. Also make sure to review your practice exams and delve into EXACTLY why you got a question wrong, and be honest with yourself. I use the feature where you hide the right answer and explanation before i get to a question to see if i can solve it again without time constraints. I‚Äôll use their explanation for hints if i‚Äôm stuck and i try to explain it to myself out loud as if im teaching someone else who doesn‚Äôt understand anything. (ex if it‚Äôs a triangle problem talk about sohcahtoa or pythag thrm etc and how you apply those skills to solving your problem) I know this was a lot but i truly believe you can improve! i honestly think you‚Äôll be able to pass the 1300+ threshold if you want to. It‚Äôs very doable you just have to put in the work and review review review and understand WHY you made a mistake and WHY you didn‚Äôt know it and WHAT you can do to fix that for next time.

1392,t3_1c4mffb,1713188255.0," **How should I START studying for the SAT?**

1. The first step should always be to realize WHY are we actually giving the SAT. Obviously, College Admissions. In order to score high on the SAT, you should know specifically what you are targeting at. 1550, 1600, 1450, whatever. Just keep it in your head always.

  
2. Second is to know where you currently stand. For that, solve an SAT PT from Bluebook. Suppose you scored 1250 and want 1550, this is where we can start because we know what we need. A 300 points improvement. Now how can I get this improvement?

  
3. Start off with the concepts. SAT is very specific when it comes to the concepts it tests. Be it English or Math, we have very straightforward guidelines on what will be tested. Make sure you through all the concepts. Solve examples of every topic you do but don't time yourself yet. Just focus on getting them right and work out reasons for wrongs as well.

  
4. Once you feel like you are going somewhere(and this normally take a month or so depending on how much time your are giving), start timing the questions but stay topical. Your score may drop because of the time pressure. Keep practicing and start with the easy ones and steadily take on the hard ones.

  
5. Once you have done this, you will feel confident enough to take on the actual tests. Now this is the real game. This will be timed and won't be topical. By this time, you should have the skill to identify question type and approach it the right way. Suppose you score 1400 this this time. 150 more to go. How to do that?

  
6. Your score breakup will help you reach there. Carefully scrutinize  the recurring errors, and figure out why you are doing it. Then make a conscious effort of going through their correct concepts again and reconcile them with the wrong explanations you applied.  
7. If you repeat this with at least 3-4 tests, you scores will increase and hopefully you will be 'test ready.'

  
Just my 10 cents. I hope it helps.",2024-04-15 09:37:35

You can also take a look at the question bank to have an idea on whether you can answer any of them by yourself. If you can't, jump into khan academy first. If you find some of the questions doable and others not, maybe you can take the test first to discover your weaknesses.

1474,t3_1c58so1,1713247264.0,"Hello friends, I thought it would be wise to share these

1. Period (.) = Semi-colon (;)
2. Eliminate any choice having a sentence in between two commas if the sentence before and after it in the question does not make any sense without the sentence in the choices.
3. Do not use a preposition to end a sentence
4. The pronoun 'which', must be placed after a preposition.
5. Whereby = by which= according to which
6. Two commas around a noun or title means that it is the only thing while no commas imply that it is one among many things.
7. A sentence beginning with 'Since' is a tip off for using present perfect i.e has been, while a sentence beginning with 'by the time' is a tip off for using past perfect e.g had been.
8. A noun is often greater than a pronoun hence always pick the noun in choices having both a noun and a pronoun.
9. Check if a statement is either a fragment or sentence by plugging in different choices and determining whether they make sense or need some punctuation.
10. A colon is almost similar to a dash

Just use the vocabulary word list for free. There are many SAT vocab books but they are mainly for SAT before 2016 version, which means that they feature some more advanced words not tested by DSAT.

More than half of the english portion is grammar, so if you master grammar you can easily get 600+. You just need to learn some rules and practice enough. I suggest taking ""course challenges"" on Khan Academy. Each course challenge essentially covers all topics of each subject, so it's basically a short and convenient alternative to giving the Bluebook practice test.

Don't worry. Firstly, that's not more than 3-4 questions. Secondly, they are doable if focus a bit.

1519,t1_kzucsyt,1713281482.0,"&gt; Do not use a preposition to end a sentence

The SAT does not enforce any such rule.

&gt; The pronoun 'which', must be placed after a preposition.

There is zero truth to this claim.

&gt; Eliminate any choice having a sentence in between two commas if the sentence before and after it in the question does not make any sense without the sentence in the choices.

What does this mean? A sentence between two commas?

&gt; A noun is often greater than a pronoun hence always pick the noun in choices having both a noun and a pronoun.

And what does this mean?

&gt; Check if a statement is either a fragment or sentence by plugging in different choices and determining whether they make sense or need some punctuation.

""Make sense""? Aren't there actual grammar rules that people can learn and then apply?

&gt; A colon is almost similar to a dash

So task one-15mins timer-dwell into the material.

and secondly, search up for pomodoro session on youtube either 50/10, or 25/5 as per your preferance. Pomodoro are focus session where you focus for a period of time, say 25mins and after 25mins exact you take a fun 5 mins break.

 Breaks are important. If you don't take breaks, you will burntout and lose your interest. These session works well, because it gives you sense of accomplishment when you know that you learnt for 50mins and deserve a 10mins break.

1780,t1_l0496ua,1713431141.0,"Firstly, try and understand that improving at the SAT takes time. Follow these step and I hope this may help you.

  
1. Solve a test in the bluebook app and see what is your score. Make a list of all the recurring errors be it verbal or quant. This also includes the questions you got right on flukes. 

2. Make sure you go through all the related concepts. Since questions and concepts tested on the SAT are very objective, try to make a conscious effort not to repeat those mistakes. 

3. Go topical and solve the easy questions first. When you feel like you're getting some grip move on to the harder questions. This may take some time, so don't lose hope if you are not getting instant improvements. 

4. Once you get better on this, start solving the other tests on the bluebook and see how it is compared to the first test you solved on the bluebook. 

5. Solve tests and work on errors. That's it. Don't look at your scores. Just what you are getting wrong and how to get it right. You scores will eventually increase. 

If you follow this properly, you will get much more than 1100 hopefully. 

Good luck! :)",2024-04-18 05:05:41

Resist the temptation to do that again. Space out your remaining practice tests. Make sure you learn as much as you can from any questions you aren't rock solid on.

My friend, stop thinking about what has happened. It will do you no good. Think of it this way, you now have a chance to push your limits even further and score more than you initially thought.

Keep working on your errors in an organised fashion and keep reconciling it with right explanations. Sounds too idealistic? I know. But possible.

Start topical and do the easy ones first and move to the hard ones gradually. When you feel better, go to the actual tests and keep writing the mistakes that are recurring and keep working on them. You'll improve. Just do it everyday.

1. Use the College Panda.
2. Work through the Khan Academy program, aiming for 3/4 levels on every topic. While I'm doing this, I'll also study Erica's grammar and then move on to reading and writing.
I think these steps will take me around 2 months, and I plan to take the August exam.
3. Start taking practice tests. I'm putting this step third because I don't want to jump straight into practice tests without a decent base. As an international student with poor English, I need to build a solid foundation first.
I'll keep taking practice tests until I'm consistently scoring in the 1450 range. My goal is to get a 650-700 in Math and a 600-650 in Reading and Writing.

If you're child is remotely competitive, or you live in a competitive area, your problem and yours alone is being late whether you want to hear it or not.  The college application year over year has gotten more and more intense and competitive.  

I think when registration opens, it opens for the entire school year, so registration for the May test has been open since last Fall, and people have been planning and prepping.

Just because you missed out doesn't mean they're missing out on your fees.  There needs to be space and proctors to administer the test.

When concerts and sporting events are sold out, are they missing out on people's fees?

2056,t3_1c8at7a,1713568030.0,"Hi all, it has come to our attention that the community is in need of a centralized database of DESMOS tips and tricks, so we thought it would be a good idea to take advantage of the community's shared base of knowledge and crowdsource some of the best tricks you can think of. The top voted resources can be added to this original post. I'll start by sharing three of my favorite ones:

**1) Finding X/Y-Intercepts and Points of Intersection**

This is probably the most useful aspect of DESMOS to me. For any question that asks you to find an X or a Y intercept, you can simply type in the equation and the point will appear for you to click on DESMOS. Similarly, if you are asked to solve a system of equations, you are really just looking for a point of intersection, so you can simply type in the two equations and click the point where they meet.

**2) Applying Function Shifts**

If you are asked to shift a function up, down, left, or right, simply start by writing the function on the first line. It is important that you write the function as ""f(x) ="" and not as ""y ="" if you want this to work.

Then on the second line, simply write one of the following:

f(x) + a (for an upward shift of a units)

f(x) - a (for a downward shift of a units)

f(x + a) (for a leftward shift of a units)

f(x - a) (for a rightward shift of a units)

Once you do this, simply click the colored button at the left of the first equation to turn it off (but DO NOT delete it), and you will be left with your shifted function.

**3) Finding Center/Radius of Circle from the Raw Equation**

When a circle is written in the raw equation \[ax^(2) \+ ay^(2) \+ bx + cy + d = 0\], you can simply write out the full equation on one line of DESMOS to see the circle represented in the coordinate plane. DESMOS will allow you to click the TOP and the BOTTOM points of the circle (but notably NOT the left or the right points) and you can take the midpoint of those two points to find the center and the vertical distance between those two points to find the diameter (and if you divide by two, you get the radius).

2061,t1_l0dkja2,1713571661.0,"1. realistically you wont be spending a perfect 71 seconds on each question. you're more likely to blow through the easy questions and spend the majority of your time working on a handful of harder questions, so just do that. in my experience when i worried too much about timing per mcq (on any standardized test) i just stressed myself out even more.   
- if you're worried about timing i would practice checking the clock every 7-8 or so questions. Adjust depending on how slow/fast you feel you're moving  
  
2. a lot of the test is not about comprehending the questions completely. often you're looking for a singular line or phrase to answer the question so read the question and scan the passage with the question in mind

3. cut down as many answer choices as you can they usually put 2 stupid/illogical options, especially in module 1. 

4. if you scan through a passage or you read a question and its just too complex, flag and skip. do all the easy things first then circle around. doing the test in layers keeps me moving and stops me from hyperfixating on a question and wasting time. 

5. the \*really\* hard passages for me were the convoluted ones with a lot of technical jargon. i found that drawing a diagram or writing down some summarizing notes helped soooo much with answering. but i only did this if i had enough time and i had truly done as much as i could with the other easier problems",2024-04-19 20:07:41

2069,t3_1c8ezlg,1713580289.0,"Sorry if this question gets asked a lot. I took the psat at the beginning of the school year without studying and got a 1370 (a 710 in reading and writing and a 660 in math), and i just recently took an (practice?) act that my school offered. I got a 32 (34 in english, 30 in math, 36 in reading, and 28 in science). Online they said they were very similar scores. 

My sister said i should do the act bc I got most of my points off in the science section (mainly bc i ran out of time reading those long paragraphs) and those are apparently easy to train. But I also felt that the psat was less stressful and i made a mistake by staying on one problem for ten minutes. Also I‚Äôm not too worried about improving my score in math for either of those, because I got almost all my problems off in those in the geometry sections and I‚Äôve forgotten those rules since I took geometry in 7th grade. 

So then would it be better to take the SAT because my english score is already pretty good, and all i need to mainly improve is my math score?

2070,t1_l0e6ux6,1713581415.0,"I did almost the same thing over the summer. I did College Panda, then Erica Meltzer's Reading and Writing books. The difference is that I did this for the paper SAT and took College Board practice tests every week. The reason for this was so I could check my progress and continue refreshing my math skills after I finished the College Panda book. I get this might not be possible because the digital SAT doesn't have that many practice tests, but here is my unpopular opinion:

1. The reason the March SAT Math was ""awful"" was because of the unrealistic expectations set by the practice tests. You could basically Desmos the whole thing without using any concepts. College Board caught on and wanted to actually test the concepts on the SAT, which is what they did.

2. So how do you avoid that awfulness? Take the paper SAT math practice tests (the old QASs + the original 10). This will definitely test the skills and concepts you need to be successful as well as force you to be less reliant on the calculator and save you time and make you understand the concepts.

3. What about reading and writing? Well, the writing test is basically the same between the paper and digital tests (but the paper does test a few extra concepts). As for the reading portion, use Khan Academy. For the Digital SAT, reading is a lot more skill based compared to the paper which did require more comprehension. When I took the digital PSAT, I had 12 seconds left on my timer to answer 3 reading questions, which I did and got a perfect score.

  
As for time, the College Panda + Erica Meltzer + Weekly Practice Test approach took me about 30 days, but I spent like an hour and a half on days I was just doing the books.

2109,t1_l0fw1lz,1713616370.0,"Linear tests (tests that do not adapt) have two major problems as measurement tools: 1) They need to include questions at all levels of difficulty, which makes them inefficient: high-achieving students waste time answering many questions that are too easy for them and that add no measurement value for those students, while low-achieving students waste time at the other end, trying to answer questions that are too hard for them and that add no measurement value for those students. Imagine it like a footrace: if you've already beat Usain Bolt, there's no point racing your grandfather, and if you've already lost to your grandfather, there's no point racing Usain Bolt. But linear tests make students do both. 2) Because of their inefficiency, linear tests need many, many questions in order to be statistically reliable, which makes those tests very long. 

Adaptive tests address these problems by taking an initial measure of students' performance and then routing students to questions suited to their ability level. By using a scoring model called Item Response Theory, adaptive tests are able to incorporate the difficulty of each question into the scoring, ensuring that students who do well on harder questions get higher scores than students who do well on easy questions. And by sorting students in this way, adaptive tests can get reliable measurements more quickly than linear tests can. 

The end result is basically the same: the score distributions for an adaptive test look like the score distributions for a linear test. (The College Board reported a correlation of 0.9 between students' linear paper test scores and digital adaptive scores.)

2126,t3_1c8ugqb,1713631573.0,"Hey guys,

Here is my score progression:

Practice test 1: 1160 (660RW/500M) (December 2, 2023)

Practice test 2: 1320 (690RW/630M) (February 1, 2024)

Practice test 3: 1450 (720RW/730M) (March 31, 2024)

Practice test 4: 1360 (650RW/710M) (April 20, 2024)

The last is one is sad, as I practiced a lot, starting after getting UWOLRD sometime after the second test. 

After the 3rd one, I kept practicing, doing 30 random uworld math questions a day, and transitioning to English questions after doing 250 math questions on uworld over time (takes around 10 days). I also practised Khan Academy on those days, completing one section a day at a time usually. In practice test 4, I ran out of time on module 2 of math, and I believe module 2 also lead to me losing time as well. For math, I must have spent too much time on other problems. I am so disappointed, especially since May sat is looming around, and I spent all this money only to increase 40 points from practice test 2, which are months apart and which is when I started using these expensive softwares. I did stop practising 4 days ago, but I believed that you should stop practising after some time. Was this an anamoly? Is my practice test 3 score the one I should take? How should I think of this? Any tips for me? I am taking a sat in a week on Saturday on as well. I really want to improve my score. ",2024-04-20 12:46:13

I‚Äôm much weaker on math.  There are many reasons for that.  My school teaches  different way to approach math, so I get mixed up sometimes.  I understand concepts, but sometimes have trouble identifying them when combined or displayed in a way I have not seen.  I‚Äôm advanced on desmos but maybe I‚Äôm not perfect.  

There are many reasons I‚Äôm not great at math, none of them is that the test is impossible to complete in the time period.  And would never say there is no way you can convince me that people are able to read problems and do the math in time.

If you model a regression statement on the equation exactly, the operation will only find one of the solutions, because only one unknown (regression parameter) is present (typically, *x*‚ÇÅ), so one solution value will be assigned to that parameter.

[Here's a technique that solves for both solutions](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/iyer3voy2z).

His math score on the March 9 exam was 750. His Khan Academy practice test math score was 770. His PSAT math score was 740.  (In other words, all pretty consistent. His verbal scores have also consistently been between 720-740.)

His math score on the school day SAT -- the one he thought he aced? -- 640.

It seems the digital SAT rollout has been rather glitchy.  I know this is a long shot, but do you think it's possible he got the easier math section 2 in error (since he said Math 1 was also a piece of cake)?

2245,t3_1c9j6t6,1713709641.0,"I graduated high school 20 years ago, and recently started working part-time as an SAT Math Tutor a few hours a week outside of my full-time job. I sometimes follow posts here and on college admissions to get a better sense of students now, and how much things have changed from when I was taking the SAT and applying to schools. I was a neurotic perfectionist then, and still am in some ways. But even I am disturbed by how extreme some students (and their parents) are on these forums.

Facebook didn‚Äôt exist until the year I started college, and iPhones didn‚Äôt until my final year. So I can say pretty reasonably that social media and 24/7 access to it is a big factor in making more people neurotic, or turning already neurotic people into more extreme cases. Twenty years ago you could still go online, but only on a desktop or laptop, and none of the giant unifying social media platforms existed yet. A lot of my college research came from hard-copy college guides. I‚Äôd care a lot about the mean/median SAT scores and zoned in on a first choice college. And I compared my test scores to other top students in my class. But it never would have occurred to me to also compare myself to complete strangers online, and it wasn‚Äôt the norm for people to broadcast their stats everywhere like they do now.

I worry that high school students now can‚Äôt comprehend any other way of identifying and interacting with the world, since a stats-obsessed and social-media based world is all they‚Äôve known. And it‚Äôs making them mentally and emotionally sick, with anxiety and depression skyrocketing in ways that we never saw before. The idea of self-worth and kindness and character seems alien or trivial or dumb to too-online kids and parents if it doesn‚Äôt lead to ‚ÄúIvy‚Äù or ‚ÄúT20‚Äù or whatever Reddit category dominates the discourse. 

And no matter who tries to tell you now that your college doesn‚Äôt define you, and doesn‚Äôt make or break your life prospects, or that the rankings are overblown, or that you should consider best fit over brand name, the neurotic mindset hearing it is so strong that it will dismiss it as hollow. If the advice comes from someone at an ‚ÄúIvy‚Äù or ‚ÄúT20,‚Äù it feels like they‚Äôre dishonest or hypocritical. If it comes from someone who went almost anywhere else, it feels like sour grapes that they didn‚Äôt go somewhere higher ranked. 

The best advice I can give is: Go where you‚Äôre happy. Listen to your gut. Find what matches your passions and values. If my life since college has taught me anything, it‚Äôs that you‚Äôll find things you love if you‚Äôre true to yourself. I‚Äôm happy to help kids improve on the SAT math - IF their college goals align with something deeper than a need for self-worth and status.

Employers do. Median salary correlates with a school's rank.

2255,t3_1c9kdna,1713712667.0,"Hello to all,

I am planning on getting the DSAT on 4th of May and had a question regarding the module design. In the bluebook tests there are 3 pre-set modules for each section. Module 1 is same for everyone. Module 2 there are two module sets. If you did good in the first module, you get the hard module otherwise you get the easy module. Nevertheless, there are still 2 set of questions you can be asked (hard or easy). But I've heard from someone that in the real SAT (unlike bluebook) the specific questions you can get depend on your performance. So there arent any defined ""sets"" but the questions in your module also vary. For example, allegedly if you make a mistake in quadratic the DSAT would show you more quadratic questions, wheras in bluebook your performance doesnt affect questions directly, they just affect which pool you are assigned.

So my question is this: 
Is the adaptiveness in the Bluebook practice tests actually representative of the adaptiveness in the real exam? 

Consequently, are your scores in Bluebook tests representative of your real scores?

So I completely forgot there was an SAT Fee waiver code I needed, and I'm eligible, but I didn't know there needed to be a code, I tried also to request one from college board just in case it wasnt already there, but maybe if i call them on a weekday they could give me it if its there?

take this with a grain of salt if you wish

**reading writing:**¬†figure out what your biggest weakness is, focus on that, then go to your next weakness and etc. go over your old practices over and over again

if youre struggling with grammar you just have to learn it, no way around that, if youre struggling with words in context (vocab) start doing quizlets with tons of words. if youre struggling with transition words make a quizlet with exactly what each of the transition words means (in addition introduces a supporting point, however indicates a contrast, ultimately states the end goal/product/result of something etc)

most of reading writing is figuring out what the SAT WANTS your answer to be (which is very frustrating)

**math:**¬†look at your test. what questions did you get wrong because you didnt KNOW how to do them. learn those concepts. how to solve linear equations, what a discrimant, basic trig functions the unit circle etc

once youve learned the basic concepts run practice problems till your eyes bled. my math score was around yours and ive noticed (for me) that every 200 or so practice problems yields around a 100 point increase for me.

overall: KEEP reviewing your mistakes, write down the questions youre getting wrong, retake the practice tests once youve forgotten whats on them (like a month if ur forgetful like me lol) and STAY on a constant schedule.

if anyone wants my study schedule or the quizlets i use/have made dm me, most importantly good luck and DONT GIVE UP! a 1450 is achievable! also pls wish me luck im taking the May DSAT üíÄ",2024-04-21 20:29:51

Sometimes I read Erica's grammar, but for now without consistency (I think what you're doing is great if your eng is not strong).  
Once I finish KA, I'll gather my weakpoints from the diagnosis + KA and focus on them. Find questions in the question bank that challenge me on them.

I don‚Äôt know how much in 15 days but if you at it, here‚Äôs the game plan 

1. Where have you lost the rest 320 points at? 
2. In these areas, pick 10 questions from each topic (There are 19 skills so 190 questions). Hit 5 skills daily. 
3. From the areas you are good at, pick 5 questions and do them every alternative day. 

This way you get better at where you went wrong and gain more confidence on where you go right - Time to make some calculated moves!

I‚Äôm currently a sophomore in high school and based on my situation, wanted to know if it‚Äôd be bad to skip out on taking the SAT (my main reason being that I want to focus on doing rlly good on the ACT). I‚Äôm going to be staying in state for my undergrad and the Uni doesn‚Äôt require an SAT score. Do competitive grad schools look at SAT scores at all/whether or not you took it? Are there any other drawbacks to not taking the SAT and only taking the ACT? Thanks so much!",2024-04-23 06:51:09
2488,t1_l0vf1ii,1713870580.0,"nah bro, there's no ceiling. I took the Sat 5 times. here are my scores in a row: 1310, 1280, 1450, 1400, 1550. change your study plan, work on your weaknesses, and don't study ""as much as possible"". rather, do less, but with hyperfocus. concentration is the key in sat. if you already hit 1400, it means you're familiar with sat concepts well. you need to refine your math skills to the max by practicing as much sat problems as possible, and you also need to remain highly concentrated. firstly work on perfecting your math score. when you start getting 790, 800 in a row in practice tests, start with impoving your verbal skills (one notion: keep practicing the verbal part alongside with math). 
if you got 600+ on verbal already, it means your verbal skills are very good and you can easily get past 700 with a right approach.  before doing anything else, PERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR, know make sure you make as little as possible amount of mistakes on grammar questions).


Next, you should perfectly know how to approach each type of questions. you know create a single strategy and stick to it while solving questions of the same type. instance: command of evidence -&gt; 1. read the question, know exactly what is being asked, it's very important! 2. read text 1. 3. read text 2. 4. relate two texts to each other, find a relationship (basically, do what is asked in the question). 

also, the most probable reason you can't score 700+ is because you skim through the text too often. there are specific types questions you need to skim , and there are some you need to scan (read carefully). 

you can most probably SKIM through: 
1. grammar questions (standard English conventions. only read the sentence with the gap and maybe the sentence before and after (depends on the question type))
2. command of evidence questions ( only read the hypothesis and know exactly what the question asks for: weaken or support the hypothesis)
3. cross text connections (do what is asked in the question, summarize both texts and find the relationship)
4. words in contexts (find the key word)
5. main idea questions (get the overview of the excerpt)
6. rhetorical synthesis questions (never read the notes)
7. 

questions you most probably should SCAN: 
1. Inferences 

Few things to know about verbal: 
1. ALWAYS READ THE QUESTION FIRST!!!!!!! Know EXACTLY WHAT IS BEING ASKED 
2. make sure you take official practice tests. don't do questions from unofficial questionable recourses)
3. find your strategy. if you're struggling with ADHD or you have an anxious personality (lol, your reddit name literally says that) , I recommend starting from the middle of each module (skip to the grammar part) 
 here's the strategy for ADHDers:
1) first solve all grammar questions 
2) vocabulary questions (first few questions)
3) reading questions (passage questions)

however, if you find it easier to solve reading questions first, absolutely go for it. 




4. don't linger on questions too much. if you see that you can't solve the question after reading the passage for 2 times, waste no more time, get to the next question. 
5. don't panic if you don't know the words in words in context questions. guess the meaning of the words by how they sound, by what associations they create in your mind and my what words they resemble. it usually works.
6. honestly, just study your personality. TBH, MBTI personality test has helped me a lot!! you can actually determine a strategy for yourself by learning what MBTI type you are. But skip this advice if you have limited time.




few things you need to keep in mind about sat in order not to decrease scores, as I did. don't repeat my mistakes: 
1. never rest from sat for more than 2-3 days. NEVER TAKE BREAK before your score comes out. until you know you've reached your goal, never stop. 
2. never study for only one part of sat if you need 1300+, unless you're being offered an Sat superscore by your school. 
3. KEEP FOCUSED, ESPECIALLY ON MATH!!!!! Bro, I'm an international student and Sat math is nothing compared to the school math in my country. but I wasn't able to score above 740 in the first 4 tries. 
4. take each question seriously. "" respect "" each question. don't divide questions into ""it's easy, so I can relax"" and ""it's hard, I'll most likely not be able to solve it"". it's a trap. 
5. TIME MANAGEMENT!!!! SAT is more about efficiency and productivity skills, rather than knowledge. the faster you're able to solve the question CORRECTLY, the better. time is very limited on SAT. 

and by the way, the March exam was quite tough, so your 1410 on March most probably means you've improved since December.

However, as someone who has taken the test my biggest takeaway is to blaze through the first 13-14 questions on module 2 so you have a pretty great amount of time on the last few questions.


If you know the math concepts well, almost speeding through the first few questions will be easy.
Demos helps a lot here. Something I've taken away is that even if you know how to solve without demos, if it can be done faster with demos, use it. It also makes sure you don't make a calculation mistake.
I realized that I found the first 15 questions straight forward and for some dumb reason went through at a more relaxed pace and didn't trust desmos enough (I wanted to confirm with my head). Then, I hit the last fee questions and realized I wouldn't have enough time because I was too chill during the first few questions.",2024-04-23 15:03:53

1st SAT: 1540 (800M, 740WR)

2nd SAT: 1540 (790M, 750WR)

1st ACT: 33 (36M, 32S, 35E, 28R)

2nd ACT: 36 (34M, 36S, 36E, 36R)

I want to know what I should submit to maximize my chances of admission at colleges as a CS major. My super score ACT is 36 (36 in all categories) but I know a lot of colleges that I want to apply to don't accept an ACT superscore. For those colleges what score(s) should I submit to prove I am great at every category?

Before I received my 36 ACT, I was planning to submit a 1550 Superscore (800M, 750WR) from my two attempts. However, now I have a 36 ACT attempt that better showcases my WR ability. But, in that attempt I got a 34 Math score which is below the median ACT Math score for a lot of schools that I want to apply to (Princeton, CMU SCS and a lot more). Is it in my best interest to submit my 1st SAT with the 800M? Should I also submit the 2nd SAT along with it to create a 1550 Superscore or is that not needed since my WR ability is well shown already in my ACT?

I want to know your guys' thoughts. Please don't come after me for being stuck up and that I should be content with my 36 with 34 Math. I know it's a great score, I'm humble about it and I'm not going around bragging about it.

1. If one part of the answer is wrong, it‚Äôs wrong
2. Eliminate any answer that is too strong, for example rule out ‚ÄúOption D. The author was absolutely discontent‚Ä¶‚Äù (maybe there are better examples but this is off the top of my head)
3. For inferences, don‚Äôt read the answers, just read the text, make sense of it, and then find the answer that matches your definition if you do good in this section

I thought my gpa was iffy and I had a 3.62 unweighted, ~3.9 weighted.  I have lab experience and lots of awards in my resume, plus a similar sat score. I got rejected from 2/3 schools with a similar acceptance rate. The third I will be attending in fall(44% overall acceptance for the program, lower out of state which is what I am). 

If you are really set on this school in specific, and you don‚Äôt get in, you can transfer in after a year at a different college. If you are more open, it may be worth looking at different colleges as backup. I‚Äôm like you. Never tried very hard in school, and was aiming for a college with a 30% acceptance rate.

This is what I would do in your situation (I am NO tutor, this would just be my personal strategy): Keep track of time, you don't have to read attentively the long paragraphs as long as you are able to find the answer correctly. Practice with KA and the question bank, time yourself on those questions (maybe set a timer of 50 seconds) . Practice will help you get faster on them. If you have time, read, read, read.

2742,t3_1cchppg,1714014980.0,"Hi. Just a forward, I'm not trying to flex at all in the post, merely illustrate the depravity of my situation. I acknowledge that it is a skill issue and that people who score better than me on actual tests are actually just better at it than me.

I scored a 1420 on the PSAT. So what? Skill issue get gud. But I'm really annoyed because I got a 1510 out of 1520 on the bluebook practice test just a few days previously. I was not going easy on myself either--I did not use resources and was timed. In fact, I actually used \~2/3 of the time because I had another commitment afterwards. Similar story for the ACT--I studied a ton before hand and was getting 35s and 36s on practice--I even did ACT's official practice on their website and got a 35. I just took my ACT and, though I do not have my score back, it went terribly and I am confident I got below a 35. 

I can't exactly figure out what the issue is. It's obviously not purely content, as I have done on practice exams. It's not nerves per se, as I don't really feel stressed at all during the exams. 

My next SAT is in \~2 weeks. Does anyone who did well on the actual test have tips? Anyone else had this issue? Any ways to practice this skill would be greatly appreciated. ",2024-04-24 23:16:20

Practicing individual problems, which you‚Äôve already done, can be just as beneficial or better. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage of the curriculum beyond what‚Äôs typically tested in practice exams. I recommend focusing on your weaker areas by revisiting and practicing exercises that have given you trouble. Each mistake is a learning opportunity‚Äîtake the time to understand why it happened. For instance, try completing around 100 exercises. If you perform well, begin timed practice to simulate exam conditions. Continue using self-selected exercises but with imposed time limits to increase pressure. Pay attention to where mistakes occur, why they happen, and how to prevent them in the future. While timing is important, don‚Äôt let it overshadow your mastery of the material. A solid understanding allows you to tackle problems effectively, regardless of speed. Although it‚Äôs essential to do full practice exams occasionally, they should only make up a small portion of your study time. Focus primarily on using study materials that enhance your learning and understanding of math.",2024-04-25 05:27:21

2766,t1_l16dfng,1714037713.0,"Also, and sorry if this is obvious to you, but your question raises an important point... Are you aware of the SAT scoring method used by the colleges you're interested in? When taking the SAT multiple times, do they consider only the highest total SAT score or do they look at the highest scores from each section? For instance, if you score 750 in Math and 700 in English on the first attempt, and then 700 in Math and 750 in English on the second, your total score for each attempt would be 1450. However, with superscoring, where they consider the highest scores from each section across all attempts, you would have a composite score of 1500‚Äî750 from Math and 750 from English. Understanding which method these colleges use can be crucial. If they superscore, you could strategically plan your test preparations: focus evenly for the June DSAT, and if one section is weaker, concentrate on improving that area for the August DSAT. Knowing this can ease your mind and help you allocate your efforts effectively. However, it‚Äôs important to verify the latest policies directly from the colleges, as they can change.

Communication is a key aspect, and as this is something you want to work on (which you recognize, which is a positive), you need someone who will collaboratively work with you to help improve your communication as they hopefully improve their SAT skills.

So i have no clue. The website and blue book tells me 27 per English mod and 22 per math. The thing that ive been practicing says 33 per English Mod and 27 per math mod.

 First off i was given these pdfs by a teacher in order to practice so i dont know where they come from. Secondly, there were six pdf practice tests that match up with the 6 bluebook pratice tests. This gave me the impression that they were the same test but no, the questions are sometimes match and sometimes are different.

i'm aiming for really top colleges so **i NEED a 1550** &lt; score, preferably a 1580+

I've really started studying these last few months and have been able to get my score to scoring decently high pretty consistently (see in images). i got a perfect 1520 on the practice SAT and have gotten 1570s and 1530s but I'm scared the practices are easier than the test itself, and that this wont translate well onto the may SAT

i took the PSAT a few days ago and I felt like I had a good handle on the math, i only struggled with one question and left it blank. i was distracted for a good amount of reading (some girl next to me was tapping her pencil louder than an airplane liftoff) and i don't think it went bad per se, but i'm still paranoid i missed things?

I've always considered myself fairly good with the reading section but once its switched to digital i feel like I'm struggling a bit, my hardest parts seem to be the **vocab and just missing information while I'm reading**

i would love any **advice on how to study for these next 10 days** to have a high 1550 score, I'm willing to take the june SAT (though i would prefer not to) but I've promised to myself I'll be DONE by then, so i really only have about a month left with the SAT. any tips on how to bridge that final gap/stay on top of things other than to pray for a good test with a good curve?

here's my **current study plan** for each weekday (i only have practice test 6 left and I'm planning to do it this saturday which is the weekend before my test)

go over all my quizlets (strategy,transition words, grammar, math stuff etc)

go over vocab (100 words a dayish, I'm not really retaining them obviously but i just want a 20% grasp on the hard words so i can confidently eliminate all the other words that i do know ifyk)

(re)take a reading section

(re)take a math section

go over 10\~ questions I've gotten wrong in the past

any improvements i can make?

thank you so much in advance

2868,t3_1cd6hxr,1714088544.0,"As you may know, the College Board has a question bank of over 2000 questions. The problem has been that every question from the first 4 practice SATs were included in the question bank with no way of filtering them out. If you practice questions straight from the question bank, you'll invariably spoil practice test questions.

To address this issue, I worked with a couple other tutors to identify every question from the 4 adaptive SATs and 4 linear SATs in the question bank in order to exclude them from practice question sets. Later, we learned that the PSAT practice test is also a part of the SAT question bank, so we identified and excluded those questions as well. This work enabled the version of the concept worksheets that u/PoliceRiot shared [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/1bwg9x1/sat_question_bank_pdfs/).

The only material difference between that version of the PDFs and the one I'm sharing here is that these exclude the practice PSAT. Also, I've added a question code in the top right corner that corresponds to an answer analysis spreadsheet, also contained in the folder linked below. This spreadsheet allows you to collect data on your performance and generate an opportunity area analysis like this one:

https://preview.redd.it/5vu8oi8duowc1.jpg?width=1884&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acaf81115a5bfd030c81451f129829f47db9bd9b

In addition, the spreadsheet will give you this breakdown for each practice SAT you complete with Bluebook. Since the spreadsheet has the answer key, you can copy the column of correct answers into the response column, then simply change answers to the questions you missed. SAT practice tests 5 and 6 have now been added as well.

Start with the Readme file for more detailed instructions, and let me know if you have any questions. Enjoy!
