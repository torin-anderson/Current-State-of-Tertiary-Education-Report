       " 'Hi all, it has come to our attention that the community is in need of a centralized database of DESMOS tips and tricks, so we thought it would be a good idea to take advantage of the community\\'s shared base of knowledge and crowdsource some of the best tricks you can think of. The top voted resources can be added to this original post. I\\'ll start by sharing three of my favorite ones:\\n\\n**1) Finding X/Y-Intercepts and Points of Intersection**\\n\\nThis is probably the most useful aspect of DESMOS to me. For any question that asks you to find an X or a Y intercept, you can simply type in the equation and the point will appear for you to click on DESMOS. Similarly, if you are asked to solve a system of equations, you are really just looking for a point of intersection, so you can simply type in the two equations and click the point where they meet.\\n\\n**2) Applying Function Shifts**\\n\\nIf you are asked to shift a function up, down, left, or right, simply start by writing the function on the first line. It is important that you write the function as \"f(x) =\" and not as \"y =\" if you want this to work.\\n\\nThen on the second line, simply write one of the following:\\n\\nf(x) + a (for an upward shift of a units)\\n\\nf(x) - a (for a downward shift of a units)\\n\\nf(x + a) (for a leftward shift of a units)\\n\\nf(x - a) (for a rightward shift of a units)\\n\\nOnce you do this, simply click the colored button at the left of the first equation to turn it off (but DO NOT delete it), and you will be left with your shifted function.\\n\\n**3) Finding Center/Radius of Circle from the Raw Equation**\\n\\nWhen a circle is written in the raw equation \\\\[ax^(2) \\\\+ ay^(2) \\\\+ bx + cy + d = 0\\\\], you can simply write out the full equation on one line of DESMOS to see the circle represented in the coordinate plane. DESMOS will allow you to click the TOP and the BOTTOM points of the circle (but notably NOT the left or the right points) and you can take the midpoint of those two points to find the center and the vertical distance between those two points to find the diameter (and if you divide by two, you get the radius).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPlease share your favorite tips and tricks as well!',\n",

The problem has been that every question from the first 4 practice SATs were included in the question bank with no way of filtering them out. If you practice questions straight from the question bank, you'll invariably spoil practice test questions.\\n\\nTo address this issue, I worked with a couple other tutors to identify every question from the 4 adaptive SATs and 4 linear SATs in the question bank in order to exclude them from practice question sets. Later, we learned that the PSAT practice test is also a part of the SAT question bank, so we identified and excluded those questions as well. This work enabled the version of the concept worksheets that u/PoliceRiot shared [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/1bwg9x1/sat_question_bank_pdfs/).\\n\\nThe only material difference between that version of the PDFs and the one I'm sharing here is that these exclude the practice PSAT. Also, I've added a question code in the top right corner that corresponds to an answer analysis spreadsheet, also contained in the folder linked below. This spreadsheet allows you to collect data on your performance and generate an opportunity area analysis like this one:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vu8oi8duowc1.jpg?width=1884&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acaf81115a5bfd030c81451f129829f47db9bd9b\\n\\nIn addition, the spreadsheet will give you this breakdown for each practice SAT you complete with Bluebook. Since the spreadsheet has the answer key, you can copy the column of correct answers into the response column, then simply change answers to the questions you missed. SAT practice tests 5 and 6 have now been added as well.\\n\\nStart with the Readme file for more detailed instructions, and let me know if you have any questions.

I was a neurotic perfectionist then, and still am in some ways. But even I am disturbed by how extreme some students (and their parents) are on these forums.\\n\\nFacebook didn’t exist until the year I started college, and iPhones didn’t until my final year. So I can say pretty reasonably that social media and 24/7 access to it is a big factor in making more people neurotic, or turning already neurotic people into more extreme cases. Twenty years ago you could still go online, but only on a desktop or laptop, and none of the giant unifying social media platforms existed yet. A lot of my college research came from hard-copy college guides. I’d care a lot about the mean/median SAT scores and zoned in on a first choice college. And I compared my test scores to other top students in my class. But it never would have occurred to me to also compare myself to complete strangers online, and it wasn’t the norm for people to broadcast their stats everywhere like they do now.\\n\\nI worry that high school students now can’t comprehend any other way of identifying and interacting with the world, since a stats-obsessed and social-media based world is all they’ve known. And it’s making them mentally and emotionally sick, with anxiety and depression skyrocketing in ways that we never saw before. The idea of self-worth and kindness and character seems alien or trivial or dumb to too-online kids and parents if it doesn’t lead to “Ivy” or “T20” or whatever Reddit category dominates the discourse. \\n\\nAnd no matter who tries to tell you now that your college doesn’t define you, and doesn’t make or break your life prospects, or that the rankings are overblown, or that you should consider best fit over brand name, the neurotic mindset hearing it is so strong that it will dismiss it as hollow. If the advice comes from someone at an “Ivy” or “T20,” it feels like they’re dishonest or hypocritical. If it comes from someone who went almost anywhere else, it feels like sour grapes that they didn’t go somewhere higher ranked. \\n\\nThe best advice I can give is: Go where you’re happy. Listen to your gut. Find what matches your passions and values. If my life since college has taught me anything, it’s that you’ll find things you love if you’re true to yourself. I’m happy to help kids improve on the SAT math - IF their college goals align with something deeper than a need for self-worth and status. And no one cares or talks about colleges and test scores after college anyway.',\n",

Module 1 is same for everyone. Module 2 there are two module sets. If you did good in the first module, you get the hard module otherwise you get the easy module. Nevertheless, there are still 2 set of questions you can be asked (hard or easy). But I\\'ve heard from someone that in the real SAT (unlike bluebook) the specific questions you can get depend on your performance. So there arent any defined \"sets\" but the questions in your module also vary. For example, allegedly if you make a mistake in quadratic the DSAT would show you more quadratic questions, wheras in bluebook your performance doesnt affect questions directly, they just affect which pool you are assigned.\\n\\nSo my question is this: \\nIs the adaptiveness in the Bluebook practice tests actually representative of the adaptiveness in the real exam? \\n\\nConsequently, are your scores in Bluebook tests representative of your real scores?\\n\\nThanks and good luck to all\\n\\n',\n",

       " \" **How should I START studying for the SAT?**\\n\\n1. The first step should always be to realize WHY are we actually giving the SAT. Obviously, College Admissions. In order to score high on the SAT, you should know specifically what you are targeting at. 1550, 1600, 1450, whatever. Just keep it in your head always.\\n\\n  \\n2. Second is to know where you currently stand. For that, solve an SAT PT from Bluebook. Suppose you scored 1250 and want 1550, this is where we can start because we know what we need. A 300 points improvement. Now how can I get this improvement?\\n\\n  \\n3. Start off with the concepts. SAT is very specific when it comes to the concepts it tests. Be it English or Math, we have very straightforward guidelines on what will be tested. Make sure you through all the concepts. Solve examples of every topic you do but don't time yourself yet. Just focus on getting them right and work out reasons for wrongs as well.\\n\\n  \\n4. Once you feel like you are going somewhere(and this normally take a month or so depending on how much time your are giving), start timing the questions but stay topical. Your score may drop because of the time pressure. Keep practicing and start with the easy ones and steadily take on the hard ones.\\n\\n  \\n5. Once you have done this, you will feel confident enough to take on the actual tests. Now this is the real game. This will be timed and won't be topical. By this time, you should have the skill to identify question type and approach it the right way. Suppose you score 1400 this this time. 150 more to go. How to do that?\\n\\n  \\n6. Your score breakup will help you reach there. Carefully scrutinize  the recurring errors, and figure out why you are doing it. Then make a conscious effort of going through their correct concepts again and reconcile them with the wrong explanations you applied.  \\n7. If you repeat this with at least 3-4 tests, you scores will increase and hopefully you will be 'test ready.'\\n\\n  \\nJust my 10 cents. I hope it helps.\",\n",

The biggest issue for me is that I can't see how I'd prep for ELA, as there isn't one type of question I get wrong, I just occasionally mess up. With math, it's different as I'm usually lacking higher level quadratic skills and advanced algebra skills in general. \\n\\nI was feeling pretty good with my progress, and then got destroyed by the practice test 4 math module 2 section, so morale is pretty low right now. This is compounded by the fact that I can't seem to get above 750 in the ELA section, and it really does seem random as to whether I get a question right or wrong, so I'm at a point where I feel studying ELA is pointless, but I need to improve anyhow to reach 800. I also need to improve on my math skills, but no matter how many times I review the Khan academy recommended section on a certain topic, I always seem bound to get it wrong as it's in a different format on the next test.\\n\\nThis all leads to the question: what can I do to improve these skills in a timely fashion? I really shot myself in the foot giving myself only a few days to review 3 years of math content, but I'm now realizing I'll even have issues with the ELA section on occasion, despite the fact that I'd like to rely on it to average out the overall score.

An \"average\" r/SAT March test taker\\'s score would be the 97th percentile among all US students (94th percentile among test takers) in Reading and 96th percentile among all US students (92nd percentile among all test takers) in Math.\\n\\n2) The US Math section was maybe the hardest math section ever. Fellow mod u/Donald_Keyman has kept difficulty ratings of the [various sections for years](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/1311v9l/april_2023_sat_difficulty_ratings/), and only 3 out of 148 sections were rated above 4 on a 1-5 scale, and those were all reading sections from 2019-2020. This is the hardest rated section we\\'ve seen since we\\'ve been doing this. The previous highest rating was 4.184. Wowza. This really does seem like a rough one.\\n\\n# RESULTS (Correlations)\\n\\nI ran correlations between people\\'s official scores and practice test scores (almost no one had the chance to do Practice Tests 5 or 6 before these test dates). I won\\'t explain what correlations are in detail (see [Khan Academy\\'s explanation](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/describing-relationships-quantitative-data/scatterplots-and-correlation/a/correlation-coefficient-review)). In short, a correlation of 0 would mean there is no relationship between the two results (complete randomness) and a correlation of 1 would mean that you could perfectly predict one result from the other. Generally, correlations above 0.7 are considered \"highly correlated\", and correlations between .4 and .699 are considered \"moderately correlated\". In our case, the higher the correlation between the official score and a practice test, the more accurately that practice test is predicts the official score. Correlations are signified with \"r\" in statistics. Highest correlation from each test is **bolded**.\\n\\n**ENGLISH****:**\\n\\n|Category|All March Students|US Students March|Internationals March|Spring School Day|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|r of Official English and Official Math|0.499|0.527|0.539|0.605|\\n|Observations for above, n=|372|266|107|37|\\n|r of Official and Bluebook 1 English|0.630|0.667|0.554|0.743|\\n|n=|235|161|74|19|\\n|r of Official and Bluebook 2 English|0.674|**0.698**|0.620|0.738|\\n|n=|195|132|63|15|\\n|r of Official and Bluebook 3 English|**0.718**|0.697|**0.748**|**0.924**|\\n|n=|160|103|57|11|\\n|r of Real and Bluebook 4 English|0.607|0.506|0.693|0.867|\\n|n=|145|88|57|9|\\n\\n**Conclusion**: Bluebook 3 is probably the best predictor for English. \\n\\nI also ran correlations between students\\' official English and Math scores for fun. Interestingly, if you pool the two March groups (U.S. and International), the correlations become worse because they have different distributions — US students had on average similar English and Math scores, but International students had on average a \\\\~35 higher Math score. Just shows how different the test is for achieving US and International students. \\n\\n**MATH:**\\n\\n|Category|All March Students|US Students March|Internationals March|Spring School Day|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|r of Real and Bluebook 1 Math|**0.647**|**0.730**|0.440|0.660|\\n|n=|233|160|73|18|\\n|r of Real Bluebook 2 Math|0.605|0.671|0.436|0.451|\\n|n=|194|132|62|14|\\n|r of Real and Bluebook 3 Math|0.602|0.636|0.526|**0.727**|\\n|n=|158|102|56|12|\\n|r of Real and Bluebook 4 Math|0.604|0.620|**0.577**|0.473|\\n|n=|140|85|55|9|\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Who knows? Before this, a lot of people seemed to assume that Bluebook Math 4 was the best predictor. It doesn\\'t look that way. All of the different official tests (March US, March International, School Day) had their highest correlations with different practice tests. I don\\'t know what to make of that. With International March students, there\\'s any interesting thing where each test is more highly correlated with a later test, suggesting perhaps that practice helps, but you see the opposite for US March students, suggesting perhaps that practice just made things worse, lol.

A few months ago I got into researching basic stuff about foreign colleges, and I heard from someone that SAT is an exam which people in the US give for top tier colleges there. I\\'m not sure how much of this information is valid and how much isn\\'t, so please correct me if I am wrong.\\n\\nI had a few questions regarding SATs, which might be stupid, but would help me decide whether I will give this exam or not. I know I can find many of these on Google but I would love to hear what others have to add on to it as well:\\n\\n1. How much is the fee to give the exam if I am a foreign student?\\n2. What is a \"good\" score in SAT to get into a top university in the US (or other countries, if they accept SAT results too)\\n3. What score could guarantee a good scholarship in those top universities?\\n4. My math is my strong part so I know I won\\'t face difficulties in that, but my English isn\\'t top notch. I don\\'t know what level of English is required for SAT, so what could be some sources to evolve my vocabulary in that direction?\\n5. What is the age limit for the exam? Does it only offer undergraduate courses? As in, can SAT be given for a postgraduate course as well?\\n6. How many marks correspond to which branch of study? As in, can I get computer science with a 1550 score but not 1450? (The scores are just examples) Or is your branch of interest your own choice and you just have to give the exam for getting access to join the college? (Please excuse my lack of knowledge over this subject)\\n7. Is there anything else I should know?\\n\\nPlease do provide any extra information for any of these, if you could. I am a bit behind on knowledge about all this and would love to know more. Thank you so much for reading this and considering to help 😁',\n",

       " 'This is an analysis of the most common math questions on the six official digital adaptive tests that have been released by the College Board. I need to know this information in order to make the questions and question-selection algorithms for Mathchops (link removed at request of mods). So I tagged every question a bunch of different ways. Then one of my partners helped me make a Python script and we did a ton of data analysis.\\n\\n1. **Y-intercept** – Usually either asking you to plug in 0 for x or figure it out based on the wordy description.\\n2. **Slope** – Use the slope formula. Go back and forth from equation to graph. Find the equation when given two points. Find the slope based on a word problem.\\n3. **System of equations** – Substitution, elimination, multiply then eliminate.\\n4. **Plug in** – You have a value or a point that needs to be plugged into an equation or function.\\n5. **Exponential growth** – Be comfortable with this: Final = Initial(1+/- rate)\\\\^time. Sometimes there are fractional exponents.\\n6. **Algebra translation** – Convert a word problem into an equation.\\n7. **Percent** – All variations: basic, increase/decrease, markup, discount.\\n8. **ax + by = c** – Be comfortable finding intercepts and the slope.\\n9. **Plug in zero for intercept** – If 3x + 4y = 24, what is the y-intercept? Equations and word problems.\\n10. **Factoring** – The basics, plus zero product property, difference of two squares, perfect square trinomials, factor by grouping, u-substitution.\\n11. **Combine like terms** – Frequently included in other question types.\\n12. **Translations** – Mostly parabolas, sometimes cubic functions and circle equations.\\n13. **Substitution (systems)** – If y = 3x + 2 and 3x + 4y = 10, what is the value of x?\\n14. **Meaning of a constant** – Usually a slope or y-intercept in a word problem.\\n15. **Plug in point** – If (4, 6) is a point on the line 3x + 5y = k, what is the value of k?\\n16. **Find the rate (exponential growth)** – When given an exponential growth equation, identify the rate (or vice versa).\\n17. **Answer is not x** – You might solve for x but then be asked, \"What is 2x - 3?\"\\n18. **Pythagorean Theorem** – Usually part of something else, like SOHCAHTOA.\\n19. **Similar triangles** – Set up a proportion based on similar triangles. They have proof-like questions as well.\\n20. **Rectangle area** – Basic or part of an algebraic word problem, sometimes quadratic.\\n21. **-b/2a** – Use this to find the x-coordinate of the vertex.\\n22. **Discriminant** – Use b\\\\^2 - 4ac to solve for the number of solutions in a quadratic equation.\\n23. **Average** – Arithmetic mean. Mostly basic but a few advanced ones, like the average sum trick.\\n24. **Given output, find input** – If f(x) = 3x + 20 and f(m) = 41, what is the value of m?\\n25. **Exponential y-intercept** – You could be given a graph or an equation. Remember that anything to the power of 0 is 1.\\n26. **Pythagorean Triple** – As in 3:4:5 or 5:12:13. Usually combined with SOHCAHTOA.\\n27. **Distribute negative** – A common trap in equations.\\n28. **Isolate variable** – These usually require several algebraic moves (+/- from both sides, factor something out).\\n29. **Ratio** – Part:part, part:whole.\\n30. **Quadratic and linear system** – In the past, you’d generally need to substitute, factor, and solve. Now, you can use Desmos for a lot of these.\\n31. **Factor out constant** – As in converting 3x + 6 into 3(x+2). Usually part of the factoring process.\\n32. **Absolute value equations** – Know that there are always two solutions to an absolute value equation. For example, if |2x - 3| = 7, then 2x - 3 could equal 7 or -7.\\n33. **Solution is intersection** – Know that the point where two lines intersect is the solution to a system of their equations.\\n34. **Match constants** – If 3x + 4y = ax + by, what is a + b?\\n35. **System of equations, no solution** – Know that the lines have to have the same slope.\\n36. **Angle chasing** – 180 in a line, 180 in a triangle, corresponding angles, vertical angles.\\n37. **Rectangular prism** – Volume and surface area.\\n38. **Conversion** – Watch out for ones that involve powers. For example, they might give you the conversion for yards to miles, but then ask about square miles.\\n39. **Linear inequalities** – You might be asked to solve one inequality or deal with a system.\\n40. **Range** – Highest minus lowest in a group of numbers.\\n41. **Fractions** – Usually a part of something else. You would not be directly tested on something like 3/4 + 5/7.\\n42. **SOHCAHTOA** – Set up the basic ratios. Know that similar triangles have the same trig ratios. Sometimes combined with the Pythagorean Theorem.\\n43. **Probability** – Usually a basic part/whole question. But sometimes you have to know that probabilities add to 1, or be careful to note exactly what the numerator and denominator should be: “Given that the student was a junior, what is the probability…”\\n44. **Identify function** – Usually linear or exponential, but sometimes 1/x or sqrt(x).\\n45. **Value/frequency charts** – They’ll tell you the value and frequency and then ask about mean or median.\\n46. **Median** – Can be presented lots of ways: word problem, table, box and whisker plot, value/frequency histogram.\\n47. **Circle equation** – Know horizontal and vertical shifts, how to find the radius. You sometimes need to complete the square.\\n48. **Factor by grouping** – Used in equations like these: 3x\\\\^3 + 3x\\\\^2 +7x + 7.\\n49. **Cubic equations** – To be safe, know the general characteristics of the graph and be able to apply common equation-solving techniques.\\n50. **Exponents** – All basic operations.\\n51. **Fractional exponent** – Rewrite radicals as fractional exponents and vice versa.\\n52. **Radicals** – Arithmetic operation, translate to fractional power, solve as part of an equation.\\n53. **Elimination (systems)** – If 2x + y = 10 and 2x - 3y = 2, what is the value of y?\\n54. **Line of best fit** – These are usually just slope questions. Sometimes they ask about specific points.\\n55. **Complete the square** – Useful for circle equations, as an alternative to the quadratic formula, and for putting quadratic equations in vertex form.\\n56. **Margin of error** – They might ask for a “plausible value” based on the sample size, total population, and margin of error.\\n57. **Multiply, then eliminate** – In a system, multiply one equation by something so that you can add or subtract to eliminate a variable.\\n58. **Area of a triangle** – Sometimes just the basic formula, sometimes part of a harder question.\\n59. **Radians** – Be comfortable switching between degrees and radians.\\n60. **Special right triangles** – Know 30:60:90 and 45:45:90 triangles. Usually employed in harder questions.',\n",

       " 'So, while reviewing the Math Kahn(because post March 9th SAT they silently changed their entire math sat curriculum), which previous to them changing I could easily whiz through. Yet now after reviewing and adapting to their changes I came across a particular problem that to me seems absolutely outrageous.\\n\\nThis is the direct prompt:\\n\\n“At a particular college, a film club and a chess club were founded at the beginning of the same month. The film club began with 16 members and gained 1 new member per month, and the chess club began with 4 members and gained 4 new members per month. At this rate, at the beginning of which month did the two clubs have the same membership?”\\n\\nAt first, the problem seems relatively simple, so I first created the equations:\\n\\nFilm Club = 16 + x\\nChess Club =  4 + 4x\\n\\nThen you can either set them equal to solve, or plug into desmos.\\n\\nEither way, you get that x = 4, and so therefore it should be the 4th month correct?\\n\\nWrong, although that’s how Kahn says your also supposed to solve it, according to them, “the beginning of the 4th month may seem like a tempting answer, but remember where starting at the beginning of the 1st month not the 0th month. Therefore the membership of the clubs would actually be the same at 1 + 4 = 5, so 5th month.”\\n\\nNow the Kahn academy is explanation is literal garbage. Because the prompt only ever mentions “same month” and “beginning of month” at no point does the prompt reference the first month at all.\\n\\nIn reality, the actual logical explanation as to why it is the 5th month is because it says “at the beginning of which month would they be the same” - and because they each gain members over the course of each month, it would mean that the fourth month would have had to have passed to reach the full membership value we calculated. Nothing in regards to “1st month”. \\n\\nSorry if this is just rambling, it just seems so silly. My test anxiety for my SAT this month is already sky high, especially considering the fact that everyone from March 9th who was getting near perfects on all the practices absolutely bombed, and considering that I also have been getting near perfects on the practices. I’m absolutely terrified of the fact that despite all my effort, I’m still gonna bomb.\\n\\nEither way, for us April testers, let’s keep our chins up, at least we know about the college boards evil trick beforehand, unlike our unfortunate March comrades.\\n\\nBest of luck everyone, tips are greatly appreciated!',\n",

The fact that the test is no longer standardized throws its reliability out the window. How well does it really tell our “college readiness” if we all have different test. If I get all of my weak areas and another guy who didn’t study gets all his strong areas he gets a higher score just because he got lucky. \\n\\nAnother thing is the lack of post test review. My first psat was paper. I loved looking over all my questions and seeing what I got right and wrong. Now that is also thrown out the window. All we get is the stupid little bars showing our general knowledge. I have no idea what I should specifically review in math except just “GEOMETRY AND TRIGONOMETRY” \\n\\nI think the digital shift is fine. But it was more than just a platform change. The very foundation of the SAT has completely changed. It’s kind of dissapointing to say the least.\\n\\nEdit: I am well aware people got different tests every date. Of course they would as getting the SAME EXACT test multiple times is pointless I agree. However that’s not the point I’m making. There is a reason many college professors curve their grade by the score of the highest graded test. If it was hard for everyone then everyone had a fair chance. If some kids got an easy test and some got a hard test then it is no longer fair. Different tests different dates is fine, however EVERY SINGLE TEST being different throws the “standard” out the window. \\n\\nThe other thing people mentioned is that “the test has a range of topics that remains the same” disregarding the common changes to it. The variety of difficulty in the 4 math sections for example is insane. To give a real life example, me and all my friends who are currently in Calc AB rigorously prepared for the SAT going over every section in Khan Academy and the digital sat prep book.
